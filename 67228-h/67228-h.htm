<p>
For two other entire days the rain continued to
pour as it only pours in the Peninsula during the
wet season, and our travellers were compelled to
keep close within the doors of the Villa de
Maciera.  Could Quentin have lifted the veil
that hides the future, and foreseen the turmoil
and danger in which this unexpected delay would
eventually involve him, he would certainly have
made some vigorous efforts to procure horses
or mules at Salorino, to push on for
Portalegre, in spite of wind or rain; but what, then,
was he to do with Donna Isidora?  In such a
November deluge she could neither travel on horse
or foot, and "leathern conveyances" were not to be
had in Spanish Estremadura in those days, nor in
the present either, probably.  To leave her alone
in that deserted house was not to be thought of.
</p>

<p>
So Quentin stayed.
</p>

<p>
Time did not pass slowly, however.  They did
not read, you may be assured, though books were
plentifully strewed about, as the French had been
lighting their pipes with them; but Isidora took
to teaching Quentin the language of the fan, as
spoken or used at the bull-fight, the theatre, on
the prado, or elsewhere, and with such a pair of
eyes beaming on him, over, under, or through
the sticks of the aforesaid fan, he proved an apt
scholar.  Who would have been otherwise?
</p>

<p>
He taught her his name, at which she laughed
very much, and thought it an odd one.
</p>

<p>
Ere the noon of the second day, they had made
great progress in their friendship, and, circumstanced
as they were, could they have failed to do
so?  Isolated and without resource, save in each
other's dangerous society, they could scarcely be
ever separate in that huge deserted house, in
which they were besieged by the weather.
</p>

<p>
That the impulsive Spanish girl had conceived
a strong affection for Quentin was evident from
her occasional silence, her palpitation, her
changing look, and the half-suppressed fire of her dark
eyes, when he approached or spoke to her; then
it would seem, that as he grew bewildered and
timid, she became bold and unconstrained.
</p>

<p>
It would be difficult to trace the workings and
describe the struggles of Donna Isidora's heart in
the growing passion she felt for Quentin&mdash;the
mere result of accidents which she could not
control, and a propinquity which she could not
avoid; or how rapidly the brief self-delusion of
sisterhood and platonic affection melted away
before the warm and impulsive nature of her
character; how reason weakened as passion grew
strong, and how she resolved to bend him to her
will, for in mind and race, rather more than
years, she was much his senior.
</p>

<p>
She knew that Spain was almost lawless now;
that ties were broken, the bonds of society loosed,
and that civil order, such as it was, had
disappeared amid the anarchy consequent to the French
invasion: hence a hundred wild schemes coursed
through her busy brain.  She even hoped to lure
him into the guerilla ranks, or to fly with her to
some remote part of the provinces, where they
could never more be traced; to the mountains of
Estrella, the Sierra de Oca, or the dark and
wooded ranges of the Sierra Morena, where,
forgotten alike by friend and foe, they could live
on unknown.  Such were her vague ideas for the
future.  For the present, it sufficed her that she
loved Quentin, and that he must be taught to
love her in return.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, it is difficult to define
exactly the feeling which Quentin entertained
for his young Spanish friend.  Of her wonderful
beauty he was by no means insensible.  Was it
platonic regard that <i>he</i> felt?  We should not
think so at his years, and more especially as we
are disinclined to believe in such love at all.
Then what the deuce was it? the reader may ask.
</p>

<p>
Flirtation, perhaps&mdash;"playing with fire," certainly.
</p>

<p>
Young though he was, Quentin could not
forget Flora Warrender, and that sweet evening
by the Kelpie's Pool, and the first thrill of
boyish love, with all the anxious moments, the
feverish hopes that stirred his heart&mdash;the tender
memories of his grande passion, for such it was;
and thus something of chivalry in his breast made
him struggle against the present tempter and her
piquante charms, for Flora's gentle image always
seemed to rise up between him and her; and
yet&mdash;and yet&mdash;there was something very bewildering
in the hourly companionship, the complete isolation
and reliance of this lovely young girl with
whom he was now wandering in solitude&mdash;a
companionship known to themselves alone.  It was
delightful but perilous work, and Quentin could
not analyse, even if he cared to do so, the
emotions she was exciting in his breast.
</p>

<p>
Where, when, and how was it all to end?
He feared that he felt too little anxiety for
reaching Portalegre and delivering the reply to
Sir John Hope's despatch; and yet, if the storm
abated, why tarry?
</p>

<p>
Quentin was soon assured that Isidora loved
him; and as he was not without that most useful
bump on his occiput denominated self-esteem, he
felt flattered accordingly; yet, withal, he struggled
manfully against the passion, with which this
dangerous knowledge and Isidora's attractions,
were both calculated to inspire him.
</p>

<p>
He was anxious to appear to advantage in her
eyes.  Why?  She was nothing to him, yet, for
some time, she had been the object of all his
solicitude.  In the course of conversation, she
admitted that she had many admirers, which, for
a girl so attractive, was likely enough.  But why
permit the development of a passion in her that
could lead to nothing good?  Why respond to
her growing tenderness?  Why&mdash;ay, there was
the rub, the lure, and the peril.
</p>

<p>
His affections, such as a lad not yet twenty
may possess, were promised elsewhere.  Was
Flora true, and remembering him still?  This
was rub number two.
</p>

<p>
Quentin Kennedy, I tremble for thee; and, if
the truth must be told, much more for the future
peace and reputation of Donna Isidora de Saldos,
for neither a wholesome terror of Baltasar's wrath
or the Padre Trevino's knife may avail her
much.
</p>

<p>
"What if she loves me&mdash;loves me as dear
Flora did?" thought Quentin; and when this
pleasing but alarming idea occurred to him, he
really dreaded that her heart might be too far
involved in those tender passages, coquetries, and
other little matters incident to their hourly
intercourse: white hands taken almost inadvertently
or as a matter of course; a soft cheek, at times
so near his own; and darkly-lashed eyes that
looked softly into his, were rather alluring,
certainly.
</p>

<p>
In Spain, women do not shake hands with
men; their dainty fingers (dingy frequently) are
kissed, or not touched at all; hence we may
suppose that Quentin and Isidora, when they began
to sit hand-in-hand looking out on the pouring
rain as twilight deepened, had got a long way
on in lovemaking&mdash;in engineering parlance, that
he had pushed the trenches to the base of the
glacis.
</p>

<p>
Some one remarks somewhere, that the fogs
and sleet of England mar many a ripening love;
but that under the clear skies, in the balmy air,
in the long sultry days, the voluptuous evenings,
and still more in the gorgeous moonlights of
Spain, the gentle passion is of more rapid growth,
and becomes more impulsive, heartfelt, and keen.
</p>

<p>
In the present instance, however, chance and a
storm&mdash;such as that which waylaid Dido and the
Trojan hero&mdash;had been the inspirers of Donna
Isidora, who, sooth to say, found Quentin
somewhat slow to follow her example.
</p>

<p>
"Mi hermano&mdash;my brother&mdash;you will be and
must be," she would whisper at times, in a
manner that, to say the least of it, was very
bewitching.
</p>

<p>
"I shall try, Donna Isidora."
</p>

<p>
"Try, say you?  Wherefore only <i>try</i>?" she
asked, with her eyes full of fire and inquiry.  "Is
it a task so difficult to feel esteem or love for me?
Go!  I shall hate you!"  Then she would thrust
aside his hand, and pouting, half turn away her
flushing face, only that the little hand might be
taken again, an explanation made, and reconciliation
effected.
</p>

<p>
On the evening of the second day, after one of
those little poutings, and after Isidora, in anger,
had been absent from him nearly two hours, she
rejoined Quentin in the boudoir, which was their
usual apartment, and where he welcomed her
reappearance so warmly, that her face was
overspread by happy and beautiful smiles.
</p>

<p>
Poor Quentin, who was at that age when a
young man is apt to slide rather than fall into a
regular love fit, was gradually being ensnared.
</p>

<p>
"The companionship of these few days I shall
remember for ever," said he.  "You shall indeed
be sorrowed for, hermana mia."
</p>

<p>
"Think only of the present, and not of
parting," said she, letting her cheek sink upon
his shoulder, as they sat, hand in hand, in the
window of the little boudoir, the objects of which
were half hidden in the twilight.
</p>

<p>
Quentin felt his heart beat quickly, and his
respiration become thick, but he said with a
tender smile&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Isidora, I am almost afraid of you."
</p>

<p>
"Afraid&mdash;and of <i>me</i>?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"But why, mi querido?"
</p>

<p>
"You carry a stiletto," said he, laughing,
"and I don't like it."
</p>

<p>
"There&mdash;behold!" she exclaimed in a breathless
voice, as she drew the long steel bodkin from
her hair, which fell in a dark and ripply volume
over her shoulders and bosom; "I am defenceless
now," she added, throwing it on the sofa; but
Quentin was slow to accept the challenge.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Isidora, to what end is all this?" he
asked, struggling with himself, and almost
remonstrating with her.  "Why allure me to love
you, as love you I shall?"
</p>

<p>
As he said this, the dark and lustrous eyes of
the Castilian girl filled with half-subdued fire;
her lashes drooped, and she heaved a long sigh.
</p>

<p>
"You speak of love," she said, in a low voice,
while her bosom swelled beneath its scarlet corset
and the thin muslin habit-shirt that was gathered
round her slender throat; "all men are alike to
a woman who is not in love; but in my heart I
feel an emotion which tells me that if I loved
there would be to me but one only in the
world&mdash;he, my lover!"
</p>

<p>
Her calm energy, and the deep sudden glance
she shot at Quentin, quite bewildered the poor
fellow.
</p>

<p>
"Tell me," she resumed, while his left hand
was caressed in both of hers, and her right cheek
yet rested on his shoulder, while the massive curls
of her hair fell over him, "is there not something
delicious in the mystery and tremulousness of
love; to feel that we are no longer two, but
one&mdash;ONE in heart and soul, in thought and sympathy?
Speak&mdash;you do not answer me&mdash;estrella mia&mdash;mi
vida&mdash;mi alma!" (my star&mdash;my life&mdash;my soul)
she added, in a low but piercing accent.
</p>

<p>
Trembling with deep emotion, Quentin pressed
his lips to her burning brow, and there ensued a
long pause, during which she lay with her
forehead against his cheek.
</p>

<p>
"Listen to me, Quentin," said she, looking
upward with swimming eyes; "I would speak
with you seriously, earnestly, from my heart."
</p>

<p>
"NiÃ±a de mi alma&mdash;about what?"
</p>

<p>
"Religion, love."
</p>

<p>
"You choose an odd time for it&mdash;but wherefore?"
</p>

<p>
"I would teach you mine," she whispered.
</p>

<p>
"Yours&mdash;and for what purpose?"
</p>

<p>
"That&mdash;that&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Nay, I have courage enough to hear anything,
dearest; for what purpose, mi querida?"
</p>

<p>
"That endearing term decides me&mdash;that we
may be married, Quentin."
</p>

<p>
"I&mdash;senora!"
</p>

<p>
"You and I&mdash;what is there wonderful in that?"
</p>

<p>
Had a shell exploded between them, poor
Quentin could not have been more nonplussed
than by this proposition.
</p>

<p>
"Flirtation is a very fine thing," says his
Peninsular comrade, Charles O'Malley, "but it's
only a state of transition, after all; the tadpole
existence of the lover would be very great fun, if
one was never to become a frog under the hands
of the parson."
</p>

<p>
Some such reflection occurred to Quentin, who
stammered&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"But, Isidora, people require money to marry."
</p>

<p>
"Of course&mdash;sometimes."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I am not the heir of a shilling in the
world."
</p>

<p>
"Nor am I the heiress of a pistole."
</p>

<p>
"Well, dearest Isidora&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Who should marry if we don't, whose
circumstances are equal, and whose position in the
world is so exactly similar?  Ah, that we had
the Padre Florez here!"
</p>

<p>
Though this was said with the sweetest of
smiles, Quentin failed to see the force of her
reasoning; but it was impossible to refrain from
kissing the rounded cheek that lay so near his
own.
</p>

<p>
Then an emotion of compunction stole into
his heart, and rousing her from the delicious
trance into which she seemed sinking, he withdrew
a little (for he had never been made love
to before, so surprise gave him courage), and
then said&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Isidora, this must not be&mdash;be calm and listen
to me: I promised your brother&mdash;what was it that
he said to me?&mdash;oh, Isidora, I must not love
you; moreover, I am pledged to love a girl who
is far, far away, and&mdash;but be calm, I beseech you,
and think of the future!"
</p>

<p>
She now sprung from his side to snatch her
stiletto from the sofa where it lay.  Whether she
meant to use it against herself, or him, or both,
for a moment he could scarcely tell; her dark
eyes were filled with a lurid gleam, and her cheek
was now deadly pale; one little hand, white and
tremulous, tore back her streaming and dishevelled
hair; the other clutched the hilt of the
weapon.  She gave a keen glance at the blade,
and then, as if to place the temptation to destroy
beyond her reach, she snapped it to pieces and
cast them from her.
</p>

<p>
Then snatching up a lamp which Quentin had
lighted but a short time before, she rushed from
the room, leaving him alone, bewildered and in
darkness.
</p>

<p>
Quentin hurried after, and called to her
repeatedly; but there was no response.  He heard
a door closed with violence at a distance, and
then all became still&mdash;terribly still, save the now
familiar sound of the rain lashing the walls and
windows of the villa in the darkness without, and
the howling of the wind, as it tore through the
bleak October woods.
</p>

<p>
Nearly an hour elapsed after this, and knowing
her wild and impulsive nature, his excitement
and alarm for her safety became all but insupportable.
</p>

<p>
"Oh heavens, if she should have destroyed
herself!  Her death will be laid to my charge."
</p>

<p>
There seemed to be no length her fiery
rashness was not capable of leading her, and not
unnaturally Congreve's well-known couplet
occurred to his memory:&mdash;
</p>

</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
When Donna Isidora rushed from Quentin, she
took her way unerringly (as she knew the villa
well) up several flights of stairs, through passages
and suites of apartments, where he could not
have followed her without a guide, until she
reached a little room, which had been the library
and confessional of the family chaplain.
</p>

<p>
Remote from the rest of the house, its shelves
full of books, its table and desk littered with
letters and papers, with little religious pictures on
the walls, a Madonna crowned by a white chaplet
on a bracket, a vase of withered lilies, and
other little matters indicative of taste, were all
untouched as when the poor Padre Florez had last
been there.  In rambling over the villa, if
Ribeaupierre's dragoons had been in the chamber, they
found nothing in it which they deemed valuable
enough to destroy or carry off.
</p>

<p>
Here it was that Donna Isidora had been,
when, in a fit of petulance, she had before
absented herself from Quentin.  She set down the
lamp, and taking up a book which she had been
previously perusing, and which she had found lying
upon the desk where the padre had left it open, for
its pages were covered with dust, she muttered&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Let me read it again, and let me be assured;
but oh, if I should destroy him or myself!  What
matter, then?  Better both die than that <i>she</i>
should have him, whoever she is&mdash;wherever she
is!  Oh, Padre Florez&mdash;Padre Florez, if this
anecdote you have left in my way should be but a
snare to death!"
</p>

<p>
Then she ground her little pearly teeth as she
spoke, and turned with trembling hands the
dust-covered page which the chaplain's hand had
indicated for some scientific purpose with certain
marks in pencil, ere he had cast the volume on
his desk, doubtless when scared from the villa by
the irruption of Ribeaupierre's dragoons.
</p>

<p>
It was a quarto volume on poisons, printed at
Madrid, and the paragraph which interested
Isidora ran as follows.
</p>

<p>
"Note of a medicated wine, which produceth
various emotions and quaint fancies, but chiefly
love and madness for a time in those who
partake thereof.
</p>

<p>
"Celius, an ancient Latin writer, telleth us
of a company of young men, who were drinking
in a taberna of the luxurious city of Agrigentum
in Sicily, in those days when the tyrant
Phalaris usurped the sovereignty thereof, and
who, on a sudden, were seized by a malady of the
brain.  Being in sight of the sea, they believed
themselves to be on board of a ship which was
about to be cast away in a storm, and while
clamouring and shouting wildly, to save themselves,
they flung out of the windows the whole
of the furniture; and in this belief they continued
for some hours, even after being brought before
a magistrate, whom they mistook for a pilot, and
besought in moving terms to steer the galley
aright, lest she should founder.
</p>

<p>
"On others, this wine acted as a philtre, and
on seeing women, they fell madly in love with
them, threatening their own destruction if their
love were not responded to.
</p>

<p>
"I was persuaded in my own mind, says
Celius, that this singular malady could only arise
from some adulteration of the wine, and
therefore had the landlord summoned before a
magistrate, who compelled him to confess that he was
in the habit of adulterating wines with a mixture
of henbane and mandrakes (the root of which
is said to bear a resemblance to the human form),
and which must thus doubtless be considered the
cause of this singular disease."
</p>

<p>
"Mandrake and henbane&mdash;a little of this
mixture, and Quentin might love me!  There is
no sea here, and he could never fancy the villa
to be a ship," thought Isidora, weeping tears of
bitterness and wounded pride.  "If I can only
bring this delirium on him, the real truth of his
heart may come out, and I shall learn whether
he loves me or loves me not, and who this
other is that he prefers to me.  But if in his
madness&mdash;pho!  I can defend myself.  Oh, Padre
Florez, was it a good or bad angel that tempted
you to leave this open book in my way, and
lured me to read it?"
</p>

<p>
A strange and deep dark smile came over the
lovely face of this wild and wilful girl as she
took up the lamp and approached the cabinet of
the worthy Padre Florez, whose room seemed
quite as much a laboratory as a library, for goodly
rows of phials and bottles contested for place with
the Bollandists, Acta Sanctorum, the Acts of the
Council of Trent, the Annals of Ferrereas, &amp;c.,
for doubtless he had been the doctor&mdash;a curer
of bodies as well as of souls&mdash;in his comarca, or
district of Estremadura.
</p>

<p>
Hastily and impatiently she passed her lamp
along the rows of little drawers containing herbs
and simples, and the shelves of phials, the labels
of which were quite enigmas to her; but on the
third occasion a cry of joy escaped her.
</p>

<p>
"Las Mandragoras&mdash;el BeleÃ±o!" she exclaimed,
as she snatched two small bottles, each
full of a clear liquid, which bore those names.
But now a terrible yet natural doubt seized her.
</p>

<p>
"How much of these may I pour in this wine
without destroying us <i>both</i>?&mdash;what matter how
much&mdash;what matter how much, so far as I am
concerned?  My life is neither a valuable nor a
happy one; but he&mdash;have I a right to destroy
him, perhaps body and soul&mdash;ah, Madre divina,
body and soul, too!  No matter&mdash;I must learn
the truth, and whether he loves or only fears me."
</p>

<p>
In fact, the sudden passion which she had conceived
for Quentin seemed to have disordered her
brain.
</p>

<p>
She heard him calling her at that moment, and
as there was no time to lose in further consideration,
she filled a small phial from both bottles,
thrust it in her bosom, and left the room,
previously, by what impulse we know not, concealing
the book of the padre, who could little have
foreseen the dangerous use to which its open pages
would be put.
</p>

<p>
With a heart that palpitated painfully between
hope and fear, love and anger, Isidora quitted the
room of the padre to return to Quentin.
</p>

<p>
He, in the meantime, had become greatly
alarmed by her protracted absence, and procuring
a light by flashing powder in the pan of one of
his pistols, he was proceeding in search of her
through the chambers of the villa, from the walls
of which many a grim old fellow in beard and
breast-plate looked grimly and sternly at him out
of his frame:&mdash;many a grave hidalgo by Diego
Velasquez were there, and many a scriptural
Murillo, sold, perhaps, by that great painter for
bread in the streets of his native Seville.
</p>

<p>
Of all the chateaux en Espagne, this Villa de
Maciera, with its episodes, was, perhaps, the last
of which Quentin could have imagined himself to
be even temporarily master.  Gloomy, empty, and
deserted, it seemed to be veritably one of the
mysterious mansions of which he had read so
much in the romances of Mrs. Anne Radcliffe,
who was then in the zenith of her fame.
</p>

<p>
"It is, indeed, a devil of a predicament," he
muttered.
</p>

<p>
Again and again he called her name aloud,
without hearing other response than the echoes.
The place was mournfully still, and now the wind
and rain had ceased, and the night had become
calm.  Well, there was some comfort in that;
with morning he might resume his journey; but
this Spanish girl&mdash;his heart trembled for her, for
there seemed to be no extravagant impulse to
which she was not capable of giving way.
</p>

<p>
To have responded to her wayward love, and
then to have "levanted" on the first convenient
opportunity, "a way we (sometimes) have in the
army," might have been the treacherous measure
adopted by many; but Quentin, apart from his
admiration of her beauty, had a sincere regard
for the girl, and though young in years, felt
older by experience than those years warranted.
</p>

<p>
He thought she might have retired to her
room&mdash;to rest, perhaps; yet he could not hear
her breathing, for when he listened at the door,
all was still within.
</p>

<p>
He knocked gently, but there was no response,
so pushing it open, he entered.  Isidora had told
him that this was the apartment she usually
occupied when residing with the Condesa de Maciera.
</p>

<p>
It was the perfection of a little bed-chamber;
elaborate candelabra of cut crystal glittered like
prisms on the white marble mantelpiece, the
central ornament of which was an exquisite
crucifix of ivory.  The floor was of polished oak,
and the walls were hung with some charming
water-colour landscapes of the adjacent mountain
scenery, in chaste and narrow frames: and then
the little bed, half buried amid muslin curtains of
the purest white, was much more like an English
than a Spanish one.
</p>

<p>
Tent-form, the flowing drapery depended from
a gilt coronet; the pillows, edged with the finest
lace, were all untouched and unpressed, so Donna
Isidora was not there.
</p>

<p>
Quentin started as he saw her figure suddenly
reflected in a large cheval-glass.  She was standing
behind him, near the door of the apartment,
regarding him with an expression of mournful
interest in her eyes; her face pale as death, her
hair flowing and dishevelled over her shoulders,
her hands pressed upon her bosom, and seeming
wondrously white when contrasted with the deep
scarlet velvet of her corset; her flounces of black
and scarlet, and the taper legs ending in the
pretty Cordovan shoes, making altogether a very
charming portrait.
</p>

<p>
"Senor," she said, in a low voice, "what were
you seeking here?"
</p>

<p>
"I sought you, Isidora; I became seriously
alarmed&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"You do, then, care for me, senor&mdash;a little?"
</p>

<p>
"Care for you, dearest Isidora&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Yet you drove me away from you!" she said,
in a voice full of tender reproach.
</p>

<p>
"Do not say so," replied Quentin, taking her
hot and trembling hands in his, and feeling very
bewildered indeed.
</p>

<p>
"Your studied coldness repelled me.  Ah, Dios
mio! how calm, how collected you are, and I&mdash;! get
me some water, friend&mdash;or some wine, rather;
and this other&mdash;this other&mdash;she&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Who, senora?"
</p>

<p>
"Some wine, my friend.  I am cold and
flushed by turns.  Some wine, I implore you!"
</p>

<p>
"Permit me to lead you from this," said
Quentin, conducting her back to the boudoir,
where he seated her on the sofa by his side, and
endeavoured to soothe her; but the memory of
the late scene, and the fire of jealousy that
glowed in her heart, filled it with mingled anger
and love.
</p>

<p>
While Quentin, all unconscious of what was
about to ensue, was untwisting the wire of a
champagne flask, she&mdash;while the light seemed to
flash from her eyes, and her cheek flushed
deeply&mdash;emptied the entire contents of her secret phial
into a crystal goblet, and when the sparkling
wine, with its pink tint and myriad globules,
frothed and effervesced, as Quentin poured it in,
the poison&mdash;for such it was&mdash;became at once concealed.
</p>

<p>
"Drink with me," said she, kissing the cup
and presenting it to him; then, feverish and
excited as he was, he took a deep draught; after
which, with another of her strange smiles, the
donna drank the rest, and, as she did so, the
pallor of her little face, and the unnatural light in
her eyes, attracted the attention of Quentin.
</p>

<p>
He took her hands in his, and began to speak,
saying he knew not what, for he seemed to have
lost all control over his tongue; then the room
appeared to swim round him, while objects
became wavering and indistinct.
</p>

<p>
"What&mdash;what is this that is coming over me?"
he exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
"Death, perhaps," said Isidora, laying her
head on his shoulder, and pressing his hand to
her lips; "but, mi vida&mdash;mi querido&mdash;you will
not go from me to her?"
</p>

<p>
"To whom?"
</p>

<p>
"She&mdash;that other whom you love?"
</p>

<p>
"Flora&mdash;Flora Warrender!" exclaimed Quentin,
wildly, as the potent wine and its dangerous
adjuncts began to affect his brain.
</p>

<p>
Whether the padre's beleÃ±o was the exact
compound referred to by his ancient authority, we
are not prepared to say, but the effect of the cup
imbibed by Quentin was sufficiently disastrous.
</p>

<p>
The objects in the room began to multiply with
wonderful rapidity; the white silk drapery of the
walls seemed to be covered with falling stars; the
pale blue damask curtains of the windows assumed
strange shapes, and appeared to wave to and fro.
The bronze statuettes on the mantelpiece, the
tables and buffets, appeared to be performing
fandangos and other fantastic dances, and, as the
delirium crept over him, Quentin grasped at the
back of a sofa to save himself from falling, while
Isidora still clasped him in her arms; and now he
believed her to be Flora Warrender, and as such
addressed, and even caressed her.
</p>

<p>
Another draught of pure champagne, which he
took greedily to quench the burning thirst that
now seized him, completed the temporary
overthrow of his reason.
</p>

<p>
Isidora seemed to pass away, and Flora
Warrender took her place.  He wept as he kissed
her hands, and spoke with sorrow of their long,
long separation; of the dangers and privations
he had undergone, and of Cosmo's tyranny; of the
joy with which he beheld her again, and now,
that they never more would part; and thus, with
every endearing word, he unconsciously stabbed
his rash and impetuous Spaniard, who, although
he spoke in English, and she was half delirious
with the wine, knew too well that when Quentin
kissed her thick, dark wavy hair that curled over
her broad low forehead, and pressed her hand to
his heart, he was thinking of another, for whom
these endearments were intended.
</p>

<p>
At last, stupefaction came over him, and sinking
on a fauteuil, he remembered no more.

<h3>
CHAPTER III.
<br /><br />
PADRE FLOREZ.
</h3>

<p class="intropoem">
  "Not yet&mdash;I never knew till now<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How precious life could be;<br />
  My heart is full of love&mdash;O Death,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot come with thee!<br />
  Not yet&mdash;the flowers are in my path,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun is in the sky;<br />
  Not yet, my heart is full of hope&mdash;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot bear to die."&mdash;L.E.L.<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
On recovering from the insensibility that had
come upon him, Quentin had no idea of what
period of time had elapsed since the occurrence
of the episode we have just described.  In fact,
he had considerable difficulty in remembering
where he was, so maddened was he by a burning
heat, by pricking pains through all his system,
an intolerable thirst, an aching head, and a throat
and tongue that were rough and dry.  His temples
throbbed fearfully, his pulse was quick; there was
a clamorous anxiety in his mind he knew not why
or wherefore; he had a recurrent hiccough; and,
though he knew it not, these were all the
symptoms of being dangerously poisoned.
</p>

<p>
The morning was bright and sunny.  Refreshed
by the past rains, the rows of orange-trees around
the stately terrace, the lawn of the villa, the
acacias that covered its walls, and the clumps of
arbutus and beech about it, looked fresh and green.
</p>

<p>
Producing a grateful sensation, the cool morning
breeze fanned his throbbing temples, and on
rousing himself, Quentin found that he was lying
on the marble terrace near the bronze fountain,
of the cool and sparkling water of which he drank
deeply, as he had frequently done before, while
almost unconscious, by mere instinct, for now he
had no memory of it.
</p>

<p>
Weak, faint, and giddy, and feeling seriously
ill, he staggered up and laved his hands and brow
in the marble basin; then he endeavoured to
reflect or consider how his present predicament
came about.  Donna Isidora, where was she? and
where was Flora Warrender? for he had misty
memories of the endearments of both.
</p>

<p>
It seemed that overnight he had a strange
dream that the former&mdash;or could it be the latter?&mdash;had
been carried off by French soldiers, and that
he had neither the power to succour or to save her.
</p>

<p>
This, however, was no dream, but a reality,
for a patrol of French cavalry, seeing lights in
the villa, which they believed to be deserted, had
ridden upon the terrace and proceeded to search
the place.  A few dismounted, and, armed with
their swords and pistols, entered the house.
Amid her terror on witnessing the unexpected
stupefaction that had come over Quentin, the
donna heard the clank of hoofs on the terrace,
and then the jingle of spurs and steel scabbards
on the tesselated floor of the vestibule.
</p>

<p>
Alarm lest her brother had come in search of
her, and had tracked them hither, was her first
emotion.  Covering the insensible form of
Quentin with the blue damask drapery of a window,
near which he had sunk to sleep upon a fauteuil,
she stooped and kissed his flushed forehead;
then taking a lamp, she endeavoured to make
her way to the room of the Padre Florez, which
she considered alike remote and secure; but her
light was seen flashing from story to story up the
great marble staircase.
</p>

<p>
"En avant, mes braves," cried an officer,
laughing; "'tis only a petticoat&mdash;follow, and
capture."
</p>

<p>
The dismounted Chasseurs uttered a shout,
and giving chase, soon secured the unfortunate
Isidora.
</p>

<p>
Shrieking, she was borne into the open air;
her resistance, which was desperate, only serving to
provoke much coarse laughter and joking.  A few
minutes after this, she found herself trussed like
a bundle of hay to the crupper of a troop-horse,
and en route for Valencia de Alcantara, the
captive of a smart young officer of Chasseurs Ã  cheval,
who further secured her close to his own person
by a waist-belt.  By alternate caresses and jests, he
endeavoured to soothe her fears, her grief, and
her passion; but seeing that the girl was beautiful,
he was determined not to release her, for he
was no other than our former jovial acquaintance,
Eugene de Ribeaupierre, the sous-lieutenant of
the 24th Chasseurs.
</p>

<p>
Partially roused by the noise and by her cries,
Quentin had staggered to the terrace like one in a
dream, and had fallen beside the fountain, so that
his misty memories of having seen her carried off
by French Chasseurs was no vision, but reality.
Yet, somehow, he thought she might be in the
villa after all, and he called her by name repeatedly.
</p>

<p>
And then there were memories of Flora Warrender
that floated strangely through his brain.
It seemed that he had but recently seen her, spoken
with her, heard her voice, had embraced and
clasped her to his breast&mdash;that Flora, whom he
thought was far, far away&mdash;the Flora for whom
he sorrowed and longed through the dreary hours
of many a march by night and day, whom he had
dreamed of and prayed for.
</p>

<p>
What mystery&mdash;what madness was this?
</p>

<p>
The musical jangling of mule-bells was now
heard, and ere long other actors came upon the
scene, as some jovial muleteers, cracking their
whips and their jokes, ascended the steps of the
terrace, accompanied by a tall, thin, and
reverend-looking padre, wearing a huge shovel hat and
a long black serge soutan, the buttons of which,
a close row, extended from his chin to his ankles.
</p>

<p>
The old Condesa de Maciera, who, after being
again and again terrified and harassed by the
outrages of the plundering French patrols and foraging
parties, had at last fled with all her household to
the small Portuguese town of Marvao, had now
sent her chaplain, the Padre Florez, back to see
what was the state of matters at her villa, and
he arrived thus most opportunely for Quentin
Kennedy, whose uniform at once secured him the
interest both of the padre and the muleteers.
</p>

<p>
The latter proved luckily to be Ramon Campillo,
of Miranda del Ebro, his confrÃ¨re Ignacio
Noain, and others, whom Quentin had met before,
and who at once recognised him and overwhelmed
him with questions, to which he found the utter
impossibility of giving satisfactory replies.
</p>

<p>
His present state was as puzzling to himself as
to the padre, who had him conveyed within doors,
and, strangely enough, into the boudoir, the
features of which brought back to Quentin's
memory some of the exciting and bewildering
passages of last night.  The unextinguished lamp
yet smoked on the table, broken crystal cups and
champagne flasks, chairs overturned, and a phial
of very suspicious aspect, all attracted the
attention of Padre Florez.  As he examined the
latter, and applied his nose and lips to the mouth,
while endeavouring to discover what the contents
had been, he changed colour, and became visibly
excited.
</p>

<p>
"Look to the stranger&mdash;what a mere boy he
is!&mdash;but look to him, Ramon, mi hijo," said he,
"while I go to my room&mdash;my laboratory&mdash;and
see what I can do for him."
</p>

<p>
The padre, who had a deep and friendly interest
in the household of his patrona the countess-dowager,
and of the young Conde now serving
with the guerilla band of Baltasar de Saldos,
looked anxiously through the suites of rooms as
he proceeded, sighing over the slashed Murillos
and smashed mirrors, and the too evident
sabre-cuts in the richly-carved cabinets of oak and
ebony, in the gilded consoles, the beautiful tables
of marqueterie; and he groaned at last over the
ruins of some alabaster statuettes and great jars
of SÃ¨vres and majolica, which, in the last night's
search, the French had wantonly dashed to pieces.
</p>

<p>
Ere long, he reached his own room, and on
looking about, he missed at once his quarto
volume on poisons, the work he had been
studying&mdash;particularly that fatal passage from
Celius&mdash;when the French dragoons drove the whole
household from the villa.  It was gone; but in its
place on the desk he found the two bottles left
by Isidora, the decoctions of mandrake and henbane.
Here was a clue to the illness of the Ingles
below; but how had the matter come to pass?
Had he poisoned himself?  This the padre
doubted; but as an instant remedy was necessary,
an inquiry and explanation would follow the
cure.
</p>

<p>
Selecting certain simples, the Padre Florez
hurried back to his patient, who was stretched on
the sofa of the boudoir in a very bewildered
condition, endeavouring to understand and reply to
the somewhat earnest and impetuous inquiries of
Ramon and his brother muleteers, who were now
en route from Marvao to Portalegre&mdash;news which
could not fail to interest Quentin; but he replied
only by a languid and haggard smile.
</p>

<p>
He told them, however, that the sister of Don
Baltasar de Saldos was in the villa, and implored
them to search for her, which they did, in
considerable excitement and surprise, leaving, as
Ramon said, not even a rat-hole unexamined, but
no trace of her could be found.  Then Quentin
rather surprised them by saying, impetuously,
that she had been carried off by the French.
</p>

<p>
"Is it a dream, is she dead, or has she fled?"
he asked of himself again and again; "no, no;
she would never leave me willingly, her insane
love forbids the idea."
</p>

<p>
Ramon, in searching for the sister of the
formidable guerilla chief, whose name was already
finding an echo in every Castilian heart, found
Quentin's cap, sabre, and pistols, and fortunately
the despatch or reply of Don Baltasar to Sir
John Hope.  Ignacio Noain found a lady's shoe
of Cordovan leather, which the padre identified as
having belonged to Donna Isidora.  This served
to corroborate the strange story of Quentin; but
Florez remembered that the donna was in the
habit of visiting the countess at the villa, and
this little slipper might have been left behind by
her on some occasion.  It was found, however,
in the vestibule, where it had fallen from her foot
as the dragoons somewhat roughly dragged her
away.
</p>

<p>
"In what way came this young stranger to
speak of De Saldos' sister at all?  Had they eloped
together?  If so," thought the padre, "then
Heaven help the Englishman, for his doom is
sealed!"
</p>

<p>
"I am ill&mdash;ill, padre&mdash;ill in body and sick at
heart!" said Quentin faintly, as Florez, watch in
hand, felt his pulse.
</p>

<p>
"You appear to have been poisoned, my poor
boy," said he.
</p>

<p>
"Poisoned?" repeated Quentin, as a terrible
fear and suspicion of Isidora's revengeful pride
rushed upon him.
</p>

<p>
"Yes&mdash;beyond a doubt."
</p>

<p>
"Shall I die, padre?" he asked in an agitated
voice.
</p>

<p>
"Oh no, my son, there is no fear of that&mdash;I
shall cure you by a few simple remedies."
</p>

<p>
Quentin felt greatly relieved in mind on hearing
this; but at present thirst was his chief
merit, with an internal heat and pain that gave
him no rest.
</p>

<p>
"Of what were you partaking last night?"
</p>

<p>
"Of wine only&mdash;champagne, which I found in
a cabinet of the comedero (dining-room)."
</p>

<p>
"There is but one crystal cup remaining here
unbroken."
</p>

<p>
"From that I drank it," said Quentin, who,
in his delirium, had smashed a supper equipage
of his own collecting.
</p>

<p>
It was a large goblet of Venetian crystal,
studded with brilliantly-coloured stones.  The
Padre Florez looked at the dregs and shook his
white head.
</p>

<p>
"This wine has been drugged&mdash;there is a fresh
mystery here!  And Donna Isidora de Saldos was
with you last night&mdash;you are assured of that?"
</p>

<p>
"As sure as that I live and breathe, Senor
Padre."
</p>

<p>
"Alone?" continued the priest, with knitted
brows.
</p>

<p>
"Alone."
</p>

<p>
"How came it to pass that her brother entrusted
her with you?" asked the padre, suspiciously.
</p>

<p>
Quentin was too ill to explain that she had
been sent with him in disguise, as the mother of
the guerilla Trevino; and Padre Florez, who
naturally conceived the idea that they had eloped
as lovers, and had quarrelled, to prevent a great
tragedy, set about curing him.
</p>

<p>
He compelled him to drink quantities of new
milk and salad oil, both of which he procured
from the muleteers who were bivouacking on the
terrace; after this, he gave him warm water mixed
with the same oil, and fresh butter, to provoke
intense sickness, to destroy the acrimony of the
poison, and to prevent it doing injury to the bowels.
</p>

<p>
"If the pain continues, Ramon, we shall have
to kill a sheep," said the padre, "and apply its
intestines, reeking hot, to the stomach of the
patient; 'tis a remedy I have never known to fail
in allaying spasms there, especially if the sheep
be a moreno."
</p>

<p>
By nightfall, however, thanks to the good
padre's real skill, which was superior to his
superstition in the efficacy of black-faced mutton,
Quentin was quite relieved, and after a time
related his whole story from the time of his leaving
Herreruela.  Florez listened to him with
considerable interest, approved of all he had done,
and gave him much good advice; but added that
he feared De Saldos would hold him accountable
for the loss of his sister, for whose treatment,
and of whose ultimate fate among the French, he
had the greatest apprehension.  He added that
his visit to the villa seemed to have been a
special interposition of heaven in Quentin's favour,
as he would inevitably have died in mortal
agonies but for the prompt and simple applications
which saved him.
</p>

<p>
He desired Ramon to take special charge of
the patient to Portalegre; to see that by the way
he got nothing stronger for food than milk, gruel,
or barley broth, and no wine whatever; and then
giving them all his benediction, which the
muleteers received on their knees with uncovered
heads, he stuck his shovel hat on his worthy old
cranium, the thin hairs of which were white as
snow, mounted his sleek mule, and pricking its
dapple flanks with his box stirrup-irons, departed
for Marvao, by the way of Valencia de Alcantara,
where he hoped to trace, and perhaps release the
unfortunate girl from her captors.
</p>

<p>
Impatient though the muleteers were to proceed
with their train of mules, which were laden
chiefly with wine for Sir John Hope's division,
they agreed to remain for a night at the villa,
where their cattle grazed on the lawn.
</p>

<p>
With dawn next day they set forth, with
Quentin riding at the head of the train, mounted
on Madrina, and feeling very much like one in a
dream.
</p>

<p>
"Come, Ignacio Noain, a stirrup-cup ere we
go," said Ramon, as he came forth, cracking his
enormous whip, a blunderbuss slung on his back,
and his sombrero rakishly cocked over his left eye.
</p>

<p>
Ignacio handed a cupful of wine to his leader.
</p>

<p>
"Demonio!" said the latter, "this smacks of
the borrachio skin."
</p>

<p>
"To me it was luscious as a melon of Abrantes
in June, after the coarse aguardiente we drank
last night," said Ignacio, who looked rather
bloodshot about the eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Of course you haven't tried the casks of Valdepenas
on the three leading mules?" said Ramon,
with a cunning leer.
</p>

<p>
"They are for the English general and his
staff, so every cask is guarded by an outer one."
</p>

<p>
"And thus your gimlet failed to reach the wine?"
</p>

<p>
"Precisely so."
</p>

<p>
"Maldita! the merchant who sold that wine
must either be a rogue at heart, or an old muleteer,
to be so well up to all the tricks of the road.
And now, senor, here is milk for you; no wine;
we must remember the orders of Padre Florez,"
said Ramon, presenting Quentin with a bowl of
new goat's-milk, as he sat, pale as a spectre, on
the demipique saddle with which Madrina was
accoutred, and which, in addition to all her other
fringe and worsted trappings, gave that stately
pet-mare very much the aspect of a mummer's nag.
</p>

<p>
Quentin, though refreshed and revived by the
cool and delicious morning air, and cheered by
the hope of being soon at head-quarters with his
present jovial guides, felt sad and bewildered
when he thought of Isidora, her beauty, her
impetuous spirit, the wild and sudden love she had
professed for himself, and the too probable horror
of her fate in the hands of the French, who were
so unscrupulous towards the Spaniards and Portuguese.
</p>

<p>
Then the mystery of the poison; it was no
doubt, he hoped, some fatal mistake, but one
which might never be solved or explained.
</p>

<p>
In fancy he seemed still to see her wondrous
dark eyes, with their thick black upper and
lower lashes, while her soft musical voice seemed
to mingle with the melodious bells of the long
train of mules at the head of which Madrina
paced as guide; and as they descended the
vine-clad hills towards the frontiers of Portugal, he
turned in his saddle to give a farewell glance at
the deserted Villa de Maciera.

THE ARMY MARCHES.
</h3>

<p class="intropoem">
  "No martial shout is there&mdash;in silence dread,<br />

  Or where the measured beat of distant drum<br />
  Tells forth their slow advance&mdash;they come! they come!<br />

</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
On the 2nd day of November, 1808, the division
of Sir John Hope broke up from its cantonments
at Portalegre, and by successive regiments began
its march towards Spain.
</p>

<p>
The whole British army in Portugal was now
pouring forward, and it was calculated that when
Sir John Moore effected a junction with the
Spanish armies, the united forces would amount
to one hundred and thirteen thousand men, to
oppose the vast power of France, which was
divided into eight corps, led by the first soldiers
of the Empire, the Marshal-Dukes of Belluno,
Istria, Cornegliano, Treviso, Elchingen, Abrantes,
Generals St. Cyr and Lefebre.
</p>

<p>
To prevent this junction was the first measure
of the French, twenty-five thousand of whom
attacked the main body of Blake's army on the
31st of October, and, after an obstinate conflict of
eight hours, forced him back upon Valmeseda.
He was without artillery, otherwise this famous
Irish soldier of fortune might have held the
ground against them, even though outnumbered
as he was by eight thousand bayonets.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, Napoleon in person advanced to
Burgos, where he established his head-quarters,
and from whence he issued an edict in the name
of his brother Joseph, as King of Spain, granting
a pardon to all Spaniards, soldiers, guerillas,
and others, who, within one month after his
arrival at Madrid, would lay down their arms and
renounce all connextion with Great Britain.  Soon
after Madrid fell into his hands, either by a
memory of the terrors of Zaragossa or the treachery
of Morla, though sixty thousand Spaniards were
ready to defend its streets and gates!
</p>

<p>
Sir John Moore was a young Scotch officer of
great experience.  He had served at the capture of
Corsica, and led the stormers of the Mozzello Fort
amid a shower of shot, shell, and hand-grenades.
He was present at the capture of many of the
West India islands; he had served in the Irish
Rebellion, the disastrous expedition to Holland,
and the glorious one to Egypt, which wrested that
country from the French; and he had been
Commander-in-chief in the Mediterranean and
Sweden.  Though superseded temporarily by the
vacillating ministry who sent Sir Harry Burrard
to Portugal, he was still modestly content to act
as third in command, nobly saying, that "he
would never refuse to serve his country while he
was able, and that if the King commanded him to
act as ensign, he would obey him."
</p>

<p>
It was this chivalrous spirit which, on arriving
in Portugal after the battle of Vimiera, made him
declare to Sir Hew Dalrymple, that as Sir Arthur
Wellesley had done so much in winning that
victory and the battle of Roleia, it was but
fair that <i>he</i> should still continue to take the lead
in the task of freeing Portugal from the French;
and Moore offered generously, "if the good of
the service required it, to execute any part of the
campaign allotted to him, without interfering with
Sir Arthur."
</p>

<p>
After he obtained the command, the utmost
activity prevailed at head-quarters to forward the
expedition for the relief of the Spanish Peninsula,
though he was left by Government almost without
money.  "He was very desirous," says Napier,
"that troops who had a journey of six hundred
miles to make, previous to meeting the enemy,
should not, at the commencement, be overwhelmed
by the torrents of rain, which in Portugal descend
at this period with such violence as to destroy
the shoes, ammunition, and accoutrements of
the soldier, and render him almost unfit for
service."
</p>

<p>
In eight days he had his troops ready, and
most of them in motion; but difficulties soon
occurred.  The lazy Portuguese asserted that it
was impracticable to carry siege, or even field
artillery, by the mule and horse paths which
traversed their vast mountain sierras; but Sir John
Moore discovered on his march that the roads,
though very bad, were open enough for the
purpose; but the knowledge came rather too late.
</p>

<p>
The artillery, consisting of twenty-four pieces,
with a thousand cavalry, he sent with the division
of Sir John Hope, whose orders were to march
by Elvas on the Madrid road.  Moore retained
one brigade of six-pounders at head-quarters.
</p>

<p>
Two brigades of infantry, under General Paget,
were to march by Elvas and Alcantara.  Two
others, under Marshal Beresford, by the way of
Coimbra, and three more, under General Fraser,
were to move by the city of Abrantes, near the
right bank of the Tagus.
</p>

<p>
The <i>whole</i> to unite at Salamanca, the general
rendezvous, where Sir John Hope and Sir David
Baird, with their divisions, were to join, if they
failed to do so at Valladolid.
</p>

<p>
Such was the scheme of Sir John Moore for
commencing operations against the Emperor of
France at the head of his mighty legions.
</p>

<p>
Before the troops marched, he warned them in
general orders, that the Spaniards were a nation
by habit and nature grave, austere, orderly, and
sober, but prone to ire and easily insulted; he
therefore sought to impress upon his soldiers the
propriety of accommodating themselves to the
manners of those they were going among, and
neither by intemperance of conduct or language,
to shock a people who were grateful to Britain
for an alliance which was to free them from the
bondage of France, and to restore them to their
ancient liberty and independence.
</p>

<p>
"Upon entering Spain," concludes this most
judicious order, "as a compliment to the nation,
the army will wear the <i>Red cockade</i>, in addition
to their own.  For this purpose, cockades are
ordered for the non-commissioned officers and
men; they will be sent from Madrid; but in the
meantime officers are requested to provide them
and put them on, as soon as they pass the
frontier."
</p>

<p>
Such expedition did the gallant Moore make,
that he out-marched his magazines; and to use
his own words, "the army ran the risk of finding
itself in front of the enemy, with no more
ammunition than the men carried in their pouches."
</p>

<p>
And now, to resume our humble story, it was
on the 2nd of November, the very day on which
the second division was to march, that the
Muleteer Ramon of Miranda and his train entered
Portalegre about daybreak, with Quentin Kennedy
riding on Madrina, looking pale, weary, and
exhausted.
</p>

<p>
"Por Dios! we have just come in time, senor,"
said Ramon; "another hour, and even the rear
guard would have been difficult to overtake.
Here I shall leave you and my casks of
Valdepenas, and then, ho for Lisbon!"
</p>

<p>
The sun had not yet risen, and the dull November
haze that rolled from the valleys along the
sombre slopes of the rocky sierras, yet hovered
over the quaint little episcopal city of Portalegre.
The church bells and those of the Santa Engracia
convent (at which Quentin was to have left poor
Isidora) were ringing out a farewell peal to the
departing British, and prayers for the success of
their arms were mingled with the morning matins
at every altar in the bishopric.  The narrow
streets were blocked up with sombre crowds of
people, and by troops in heavy marching order.
All betokened hasty preparations for advancing to
the front, and amid the loud vivas of the
Portuguese could be heard the wailing of the poor
soldiers' wives who were to be left behind for on
the 10th October, Sir John Moore, who, though
brave as a lion, was tender as a woman, and
whose love and devotion for his mother was a
leading characteristic throughout his short but
brilliant life, issued the following order:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"As in the course of the long march which the
army is about to undertake, and where no carls
will be allowed, the women would unavoidably be
exposed to the greatest hardship and distress,
commanding officers are, therefore, desired to use
their endeavours to prevent as many as possible,
<i>particularly those having young children</i>, or such
as are not stout or equal to fatigue, from following
the army.  An officer will be charged to draw
their rations, and they will be sent back to
England by the first good opportunity; and, when
landed, they will receive the same allowance
which they would have been entitled to if they had
not embarked, to enable them to reach their homes."
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, implicit obedience was not paid
to this humane order, and thus many women, with
their children, followed the troops in secret, and
thus many, if not all, perished by the way, during
the horrors of the retreat to Corunna.
</p>

<p>
Among these, inspired by love and trust, who
courageously followed the army on foot and in
secrecy, or sometimes mounted on a poor lean
burro, which they grazed by the wayside, was the
wife of Allan Grange, the poor sergeant, reduced
at Colchester barracks, a fragile and ailing creature,
who bore a pale, sickly, and consumptive little
baby at her breast.
</p>

<p>
The advanced guard of Light Dragoons, with,
oats and forage trussed in nets and bags upon the
cruppers, had already been detailed, and were in
their saddles, half a mile in front of the city, at the
base of the hill on which it stands.
</p>

<p>
The twenty-four pieces of artillery were all in
readiness, the trails limbered up and the horses
traced, with water-buckets, spare wheels and
forge-waggon, the gunners in their seats and saddles.
</p>

<p>
The massed columns of infantry were in heavy
marching order, with great-coats rolled, canteens
and havresacks slung crosswise, with colours, in
some instances cased, and locks hammerstalled;
the cavalry were in the great plaza, in close column
of troops, every man riding with a net of forage
(chopped straw or whins) behind him; the
baggage-animals&mdash;horses, mules, and burros&mdash;already
laden with tents, bags, beds, boxes, and
camp-kettles, amid the cracking of whips, and
oaths uttered in English, Irish, Spanish, and
Portuguese, were driven forth to make way for
the troops, who, while staff and other officers
galloped about as if possessed by so many devils,
began their march for Spain.
</p>

<p>
Bewildered by the confusion and hurly-burly
of the scene amid which he so suddenly found
himself, and thrust by the pressure of the crowd
against the wall of the Santa Engracia convent,
Quentin sat in the saddle of Madrina and saw
nearly the whole division of Sir John Hope defile
before him, a long and glittering array, for as the
golden light of the sun poured along the picturesque
vista of the ancient street, and the white
rolling mists were dispelled or exhaled upward,
the burnished barrels, bayonets, and sword-blades,
the polished brasses of the accoutrements, and the
glazed tops of the shakos, all flashed and shone,
while the thoroughfares resounded to the tramp
of horse and foot, spurs, scabbards, and chain
bridles&mdash;to the sharp blare of the cavalry
trumpets, the drums of the infantry, and the hoarse
war pipes of the plaided Highlanders&mdash;the wild,
strange music that Scotsmen only <i>feel</i> or understand.
</p>

<p>
Many of the soldiers were pale and wan, from
the comfortless wards of Belem hospital, and many
a bandaged head, many an arm in a scarf, and
plaster on a cheek, showed the part they had
borne at Roleia and Vimiera, and in the struggle
which had just freed Portugal from those who
aimed at the conquest of Europe.
</p>

<p>
Uniforms already old and thriftily patched with
cloth of divers colours, housings faded, chabraques
worn bare, gun carriages minus paint and oil, as
they rumbled along; all spoke of service and hard
work&mdash;of harder work and keener service yet to
come!
</p>

<p>
And now advanced a corps, on hearing the
well-known air played by whose drums and fifes,
Quentin made a leap from the saddle of Madrina,
and forced a passage through the dense crowd,
for it was the 25th, "The King's Own Borderers,"
with the Castle of Edinburgh shining on their
colours, and all their old honours&mdash;"Nisi Dominus
Frustra," Egypt, and Egmont-op-Zee, that
debouched into the main street of Portalegre in a
dense close column of sections, nine hundred
men, all marching as one to their old quick step
of a thousand memories&mdash;
</p>

<p>
  "All the blue bonnets are bound for the border,"<br />
</p>

<p>
or General Leslie's march to Long-Marston Moor
in the days of the great civil war.
</p>

<p>
Endued with fresh strength by the sight of the
regiment, Quentin burst through the crowd, and,
reaching the grenadiers, grasped the hand of
Rowland Askerne, on whose breast he saw a
Portuguese order glittering.
</p>

<p>
"Quentin Kennedy, by all that's wonderful!"
exclaimed the tall captain, grasping his hand
warmly in return.  "Quentin, my boy, how goes it?"
</p>

<p>
"Hallo! talk of the&mdash;&mdash;" began Monkton,
clapping him on the back; "we were just talking
about you&mdash;thought you lost, gone, and all that
sort of thing, a martyr to duty; but welcome
back, my dear lad!"
</p>

<p>
"Where is old Major Middleton?"
</p>

<p>
"With Buckle in rear of the column."
</p>

<p>
"And little Boyle?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Pimple is with Colyear carrying the
colours; but where have you been, and what the
deuce have you been about, eh?"
</p>

<p>
"You look pale and weary to begin a march
this morning, sir," said some of the soldiers,
kindly, for Quentin was a favourite with them
all.
</p>

<p>
"You must have a horse," said Askerne:
"you look absolutely ill, Quentin; how is this?"
</p>

<p>
"It is a long story, Askerne," replied Kennedy,
with a haggard smile.
</p>

<p>
"Egad, I thought, and we <i>all</i> thought, the
duty one beyond your years and experience."
</p>

<p>
"Make way here in front, please; mark time,
the grenadiers," said an authoritative voice as the
column issued from the city gate, and an officer
who nearly rode our hero down, pushed his horse
between the band and the first section of the
grenadier company.  Quentin looked indignantly
up, and found the cold, stern, and uncompromising
eye of Cosmo, the Master of Rohallion, steadily
bent upon him.
</p>

<p>
"You have returned, sir, <i>at last</i>?" was his
stiff response to Quentin's hasty salute.
</p>

<p>
"It is little short of a miracle that I ever
returned at all, Colonel Crawford; I have
undergone no small danger I beg to assure you, and
have but this instant entered Portalegre.  I have
acquitted myself of the duty with which the
general did me the honour to entrust me.  The
junction will be formed with our division on the
march, and I have a despatch from the Guerilla
Chief."
</p>

<p>
"For whom?"
</p>

<p>
"Sir John Hope, sir; shall I give it to him
in person?"
</p>

<p>
"No&mdash;I shall myself deliver it," replied Cosmo,
who feared naturally the favourable impression
which Quentin might make on the good
general, to whom he had been represented as
unworthy; "get your musket and fall in with
your company as soon as possible.  We shall
have some <i>other</i> work cut out for you ere long,"
added Cosmo, with a dark and scornful smile, as
he took, or rather snatched the despatch from
Quentin, who seemed more fit for a sick bed than
for marching among the sturdy grenadiers of the
Borderers; but for that day he was attached to
the baggage guard, which was under Lieutenant
Colville, and this arrangement for his comfort
was made by the kindness of the old halberdier
Norman Calder, who was now sergeant-major.
He rode the spare horse of Major Middleton, a
boon but for which he could never have kept up
with the troops.
</p>

<p>
With the baggage marched the rear guard of
the division, having with it the sick, the drunk,
disorderly, and prisoners, together with a medley
of followers of a not very reputable kind, whose
presence was not conducive to reflection or
comfort, and who noisily scorned alike control or
discipline.
</p>

<p>
As Quentin was riding thus, he was passed
from the rear by the general and his staff.  The
former gave him a keen and inquiring glance,
answered his salute briefly, and passed on.
Whether Cosmo had mentioned him favourably,
or the reverse, in delivering the despatch of Don
Baltasar, he knew not; but he knew that when
once the spiteful element attains ascendancy in
the human heart, there is no mode in which it
will not seek to be gratified and no measure to
its malignity, and he sighed over an enmity that
he dared neither to grapple with or hope to
overcome; and all this he owed to the preference of
Flora Warrender for him&mdash;her early friend and
playmate in youth.
</p>

<p>
Well, there was some consolation in the cause!
</p>

<p>
Though his reception by the Master of Rohallion
neither disappointed nor shocked him, it
chilled the poor lad's heart, which grew heavy
as he saw how unavailing and how fruitless were
all his efforts to deserve praise or to win honour!

CHAPTER V.
<br /><br />
HALT AT AZUMAR.
</h3>

<p class="intropoem">
  "Pleasures fled hence, wide now's the gulf between us;<br />
  Stern Mars has routed Bacchus and sweet Venus:<br />
  I can no more&mdash;the lamp's fast fading ray<br />
  Reminds me of parade ere break of day,<br />
  Where, shivering, I must strut, though bleak the morning,<br />

<p>
The noisy racket maintained by those who were
in custody of the rear-guard, the voices of others
who whipped or cheered on the long string of
baggage animals (Evora horses, Castilian mules,
and sturdy burros or donkeys), the various novel
sights and sounds incident to the march of Hope's
division, together with the appearance of the
division itself winding down the deep valleys and
up the steep mountains like a long and glittering
snake, amid clouds of white dust, out of which
the sheen of arms and the waving of colours came
incessantly, won Quentin from his sadder thoughts,
and he began to feel, after all he had undergone,
an emotion, of joy on finding himself among his
old comrades&mdash;a joy that can only be known
by a soldier&mdash;by one forming a part of that great
and permanent, but almost always happy family,
a regiment of the line.
</p>

<p>
The morning was bright and breezy; the large
floating clouds cast their flying shadows over the
sunlit landscape at times, adding alike to its
beauty and the striking effect of the marching
columns.
</p>

<p>
Weary of the dark and sallow Spaniards,
Quentin's eyes had run along the ranks of the
25th, and their familiar faces, which seemed so
fair and ruddy when contrasted with those of
the nations they had come to free, were pleasant
to look upon.
</p>

<p>
Their colours, with the castle triple-towered
and the city motto; the familiar bugle calls, and
more than all, the old quick-step of General
Leslie, which came floating rearward from time
to time when the corps traversed an eminence,
all spake to him of his new but moveable home,
and the new associations he had learned to love.
</p>

<p>
Cosmo&mdash;the impracticable and inscrutable&mdash;Cosmo
Crawford&mdash;alone was the feature there that
marred his prospects and blighted his pleasure!
</p>

<p>
He felt a sincere regret for poor Isidora, and
this was not unmingled with a little selfish dread
of her brother, De Saldos, the scowling Trevino,
and others, when those guerillas joined the
division, which they would probably do in the course
of a day or so; and what answer would he make
to them when they&mdash;and chiefly her brother&mdash;asked
for the missing donna?  He felt himself,
indeed, between the horns of a dilemma, and
many unpleasant forebodings mingled with his
dreams of a brilliant future.
</p>

<p>
Amid these ideas recurred the longing to write
home (how long, long seemed the time that had
elapsed since he left it!) that the good Lord
Rohallion and the gentle Lady Winifred&mdash;that
dear Flora, and the old quartermaster too, might
learn something of what he had seen, and done,
and undergone since last they parted.
</p>

<p>
Had Cosmo, in any of his letters, ever written to
announce that he was serving with the Borderers?
</p>

<p>
This was a question Quentin had frequently
asked of himself, and he felt certain that the
colonel had not done so, as in the other instance,
and unless he had been cruelly misrepresented,
Lord Rohallion or worthy John Girvan, and his
old mentor the quaint dominie, would assuredly
have written to him long since.  Thus it was
evident that in his correspondence with those at
home in Carrick, the haughty Master had totally
ignored his name.
</p>

<p>
Quentin's passion for Flora Warrender was a
boyish devotion that mingled with all his love and
all his memories of home.  She was still a guiding
star to his heart and hopes, the impulse of
every thought, the mainspring of every act and
deed; and thus Quentin felt that while this dear
girl at home loved him&mdash;as sister, friend, and
sweetheart all combined, the spiteful hauteur of
Cosmo was innocuous and pointless indeed.
</p>

<p>
As the paymaster of the regiment was riding
with the rear-guard, Quentin lost no time in
placing in his hands a sufficient number of those
gold moidores that were found in the repositories
of the late Corporal Raoul, of the 24th Chasseurs
a Cheval (the spoil so liberally shared with him
by Ribeaupierre), for the purpose of having them
transmitted by bill or otherwise to the quartermaster
at Rohallion, to repay the good man for
the forty pounds he had placed at his disposal
on the night he left the castle to return no
more; and the fact of this debt being off his
conscience made his spirit more buoyant than ever.
</p>

<p>
They were now marching through the province
of Alentejo, the land of wine and oil, the
granary of Portugal.  Long-bearded goats and great
bristly swine were to be seen in all the pastures,
but few or no horned cattle.  Proceeding on a
line parallel with the Spanish frontier, they
passed through the fortified town of Alegrete,
which is moated round by the small river Caia,
and there each regiment made its first brief halt
for a few minutes before pushing on to Azumar,
some fourteen miles from Portalegre, where the
division was to pass the night.
</p>

<p>
Those halts on the line of march were so brief
that the bugles of the leading corps always
sounded the advance when those of the rear were
sounding the halt&mdash;ten minutes being the utmost
time allotted.
</p>

<p>
On reaching Azumar, the lieutenant-general
with his staff, and the colonels of corps, found
quarters in the castle of the counts of that name,
while the rest of the troops remained without the
walls of the town.
</p>

<p>
The night was fine for the season, and clear
and starry; a pinkish flush, that lingered beyond
the summits of the Sierra Alpedriera to the
westward, showed where the November sun had set.
Tents were pitched for the whole force; but,
before turning in for the night, Captain Askerne,
Monkton, and other Borderers, preferred to sup
in a cosy nook, sheltered by a ruined vineyard
wall and a group of gigantic chestnuts, under
which their servants had lighted a rousing fire of
dry branches and wood, hewn down by the
pioneers' hatchets.
</p>

<p>
Each added the contents of his havresack to
the common stock of the party, and in the same
fraternal fashion they shared the contents of their
canteens, flasks, and bottles; thus various kinds of
liquor, wine&mdash;brandy, and aguardiente, were
contributed.  What the repast lacked in splendour
or delicacy was amply made up for by good
humour and jollity, and to those who had an
eye for the picturesque, that element was not
wanting.
</p>

<p>
In the foreground the red glaring fire cast its
light on the soldierly fellows we have introduced
to the reader, as they sat or lounged on the grass
in their regimental greatcoats, or cloaks of blue
lined with scarlet, and their swords and belts
beside them.  The great chestnut trees were well-nigh
leafless now, and with the rough masonry of the old
wall, coated with heavily-leaved vine and ivy,
formed a background.
</p>

<p>
Further off, in another direction, were the
glares of other watchfires, around which similar
groups were gathered&mdash;fires that shed their light
in fitful flashes on the long rows of white bell-tents,
on the dark figures that flitted to and fro,
and on the forms of the distant and solitary
sentinels, who stood steadily on their posts, the point
of each man's bayonet shining like a red star as
the flame tipped it with fire.
</p>

<p>
"Here comes Colville," said Monkton, as that
individual, who was somewhat of a dandy and
man of fashion, lounged slowly up, and cast himself
languidly on the grass.  "You have just been
with the colonel, I suppose?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes&mdash;a deuced bore&mdash;to report the baggage
all up with the battalion, the guard dismissed to
their tents, and luckily, no casualties, save a
mule that we lost in a bog."
</p>

<p>
"And you found him bland, as usual?"
</p>

<p>
"I found him quartered, not in the castle, as I
expected, but in a deserted house half ruined by
the French," replied Colville, smiling; "the only
habitable apartment was the kitchen, where our
colours are lodged, and there he was eating a
tough bullock steak, embers and all, just as his
man had cooked it, on the ramrod of an old
pistol.  Egad, it was a picture!"
</p>

<p>
"A dainty kabob we should have called it in
Egypt," said Major Middleton, laughing, with a
huge magnum-bonum bottle of brandy-and-water
placed between his fat legs.  "Ah, the Honourable
Cosmo should not have quitted his guardsman's
comforts at the York Coffee-house, or Betty
Neale's fruit-shop in St. Jameses Street,* to
rough it with the line in the Peninsula!"
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
* Two favourite resorts of the Household Brigade in those
days.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"Did he compliment you on bringing up your
disorderly charge without other loss than the
mule?" asked Askerne.
</p>

<p>
"The devil a bit," yawned Colville; "with
his glass stuck in his eye, he gave me one of his
cool stares, and said, briefly, 'That will do,
sir&mdash;to your company.'"
</p>

<p>
"Ah," grumbled Middleton, shaking his old
head, while his pigtail swayed to and fro, "the
colonel may have in his veins good blood, as it is
called, but he has in his heart about as much of
the milk of human kindness as if it belonged
to an old lawyer."
</p>

<p>
The last part of the sentence, we are bound to
add, was partly mumbled into the mouth of the
magnum, which at that moment the major applied
to his own.
</p>

<p>
"Here comes Dick Warriston," said Monkton,
as an officer muffled in a cloak approached.
"Hallo, Dick&mdash;how goes it, man?"
</p>

<p>
"Good evening, gentlemen&mdash;thought I should
find you out.  I heard on the march that our
friend the volunteer had turned up again.  How
are you, Kennedy? glad to see you safe and
sound once more," said Quentin's old friend, as
they shook hands, and he cast his ample blue
muffling aside, displaying his well-built figure,
with the scarlet coat, green lapels, and massive
gold epaulettes of the Scots Brigade.
</p>

<p>
"Be seated, Dick."
</p>

<p>
"Thanks, Askerne."
</p>

<p>
"Do you prefer a chair, or a sofa?" asked
Monkton.
</p>

<p>
"The sofa, by all means," replied Warriston,
stretching himself on the grass.
</p>

<p>
"There is brandy in that jar beside you, and
Lisbon wine in the bottle.  Here, under these fine
old chestnuts, we are quite a select little pic-nic
party, out of range of shot, shell, and everything&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Except fireflies and mosquitoes, Willie&mdash;a
poor substitute for the girls, God bless
them."
</p>

<p>
"Whose trumpets are these? what's up now?"
asked Monkton, as a sharp cavalry call rang upon
the night.
</p>

<p>
"The 3rd Dragoons of the German Legion,
Burgwesel's regiment, are watering their horses."
</p>

<p>
"Those Germans are regular trumps in their
order and discipline," said Monkton; "but as for
the Portuguese, damme, they are not worth their
liquor.  Even the Johnny Crapauds despise them.
You have just come in time, Warriston, to hear
Kennedy relate to us his interview with the
guerilla chief; go on, lad, we are all listening,"
he added, as he and others proceeded to light
their cigars or charge their pipes for a thorough
bout of smoking.
</p>

<p>
Quentin told them briefly as much of his
adventures as he deemed it necessary to relate or
reveal, from the time of his parting from
Askerne to the hour of his return to Portalegre.
The slaughter of the French prisoners at Herreruela
drew forth loud execrations and unanimous
condemnation.  His illness at the Villa de
Maciera was alone a mystery which he could not
explain, and the manner in which he consequently
and naturally blundered in narrating this part of
his story, drew forth the laughter and the empty
jests of the younger portion of his audience.
</p>

<p>
"Damme," said Monkton, "you were a bold
fellow, Kennedy, to become spooney on the sister
of such a melo-dramatic individual&mdash;such a regular
'heavy villain' as this guerilla De Saldos!
Egad, the sight of the fellow, with those black
moustachios you have described, each like a
snake twisted under his hooked nose, would be
enough to frighten the French!"
</p>

<p>
"Very singular style of person, your Spanish
friend, I should think," lisped Colville, with his
glass in his eye.
</p>

<p>
"Remarkably so," added Ensign Pimple, raising
his white eyebrows; "decidedly a dangerous
fellow to have a shindy with!"
</p>

<p>
"A most interesting individual, no doubt,"
said Buckle the adjutant; "but begad, not at all
suited to a quiet rubber or a little supper party;
takes mustard to his lamb, perhaps, and pepper
to his enchanted eggs, but knows nothing, I'll
be bound, of a devilled kidney, a broiled bone, and
a tumbler of decent whisky toddy.  'Full of
strange oaths, and bearded like the pard;' he is
all spasms, big boots, and blue fire&mdash;eh?"
</p>

<p>
While they jested thus, and Quentin, with
something of annoyance and vexation, looked
from one to another, Askerne and Warriston, who
were men of graver mood, had been eyeing him
attentively.
</p>

<p>
"My poor lad,"' said the former, laying a hand
kindly on his shoulder, "all this that you have
related was a sad trial for you&mdash;a great test of
courage and discretion for one so young to be
subjected to, especially in a foreign country, and
among a people so fierce and lawless."
</p>

<p>
"Your pistols were always my friends," said
Quentin, laughing; "I thought of them in every
extremity, Captain Askerne; but fortunately never
had to use them."
</p>

<p>
"Then keep them, Quentin, my boy, as a
little present from me," said the grenadier.
</p>

<p>
"But to deprive you&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Matters nothing&mdash;I took a handsome pair of
silver-mounted pops from the holsters of a French
officer the other day."
</p>

<p>
"Askerne has but anticipated me," said Warriston;
"I had resolved to give you mine, though
they were a gift to me from my father's old
friend the Conservator of Scottish Privileges at
Campvere, when the Scots Brigade came home
and turned their backs upon honest old Holland
for ever."
</p>

<p>
"Well, Kennedy," said Monkton, with a droll
twinkle in his eye, "we've heard all your adventures,
at least <i>so much</i> as you wisely, prudently,
and discreetly choose to tell us; but I cannot
help thinking that we could make a few interesting
notes on the time spent in that ruined ChÃ¢teau
en Espagne.  Was the donna young, black-eyed,
beautiful, and all that sort of thing, eh?"
</p>

<p>
"By Jove," added Colville, in the same tone,
"you are a regular St. Francis, or St. Anthony!
But unlike you, if the donnas on the other side
of the frontier think me worth their while, I am
ready to be subjected to any amount of seduction
the dear creatures may choose to put in
practice."
</p>

<p>
Affecting neither to hear Monkton's banter
nor Colville's addition, Quentin turned to
Askerne, admiring the order that glittered on his
left breast.
</p>

<p>
"This is Portuguese?" said he.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Quentin&mdash;the Tower and Sword&mdash;given
to me by the Junta of Oporto for capturing an
exploring party, consisting of an officer and ten
French dragoons of Ribeaupierre's regiment,
whom I cut off in a narrow valley near Portalegre
(on the very day after you left us), where I
had been sent with twenty of ours to bring in
forage."
</p>

<p>
"Askerne, I do envy you this decoration!"
said Quentin, whose eyes sparkled with genuine
pleasure and admiration, for medals were almost
unknown in the British army then, and the Bath,
as now, was only given to field officers; "and
they were, you say, dragoons of Ribeaupierre?"
</p>

<p>
"The same corps with some of whom you fell
in among the Spanish mountains.  They are
quartered in Valencia de Alcantara."
</p>

<p>
"Ribeaupierre!" said the bantering Monkton;
"there is a name for an intelligent young man
to go to bed with!  It smacks of Anne Radcliffe's
mysterious romances of 'Sicily' and 'The Forest.'"
</p>

<p>
"Yet it is the name of an officer as brave as
any in France," said Quentin; "the general who
bears it was a subaltern with Napoleon in the
Regiment of La Fere, a town on an island of the
Oise, where it was originally raised."
</p>

<p>
"Like that corps, the 24th Chasseurs Ã  Cheval
were originally under the monarchy," said Warriston.
</p>

<p>
"Their uniform is light green, faced and
lapelled with white?"
</p>

<p>
"Exactly, Quentin&mdash;the same uniform worn
by the Emperor on almost every occasion,"
replied Warriston; "the 24th were long known as
the Disinterested Regiment of Chartres."
</p>

<p>
"An honourable title," said Askerne; "how
came they to win it, thou man of anecdote?"
</p>

<p>
"About nineteen years ago, when the troubles
of the Revolution were first beginning, the
regiment was quartered at Le Mans, a town of France
situated on the river Sarthe, if you have not
forgotten your geography, Rowland.  The corps
then belonged&mdash;such was the French aristocratic
term&mdash;to Louis Philip Joseph, Duke of Orleans,*
the notorious 'EgalitÃ©' who was guillotined by
the mob in 1793; but it was denominated 'of
Chartres,' from the county of the name gifted
to his ancestor by Louis XIV.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
* Father of Louis Philippe I., late King of the French.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"The outrages of the Revolutionists were at
their height around the whole of Mans.  Day
and night the dragoons of Chartres remained
with their accoutrements on and their horses
saddled ready to assist the magistrates and all
peaceable citizens.  Every day brought tidings
of new horrors in the rural districts, and every
night saw the sky reddened by the flames of
burning chateaux, convents, and abbey-churches,
whose occupants were given to pillage and death.
</p>

<p>
"So resolute and orderly were the dragoons
of Chartres, so sturdily and bravely did they
protect the weak against the strong, enforce the
public peace, and conduct the transit of corn for
the poor, that the magistrates deemed it necessary
to make some acknowledgment of their services.
A vote of thanks from the municipality preceded
a gratuity of eight hundred livres (no great sum
among us certainly, but a handsome one on the
other side of the Channel) to be distributed among
the three hundred Chasseurs of the corps.
</p>

<p>
"In a large bag the money, made, by the way,
from the church bells of France, was sent to the
colonel, who gave it to the men to dispose of as
they pleased; upon which, instead of dividing it
among themselves, they resolved unanimously to
bestow it upon a portion of the very people who
had been tormenting their lives for the last six
months.
</p>

<p>
"One of the dragoons, a mere youth named
Raoul, waited upon the Rector of St. Nicholas
in the city of Le Mans and handing him the bag
with its contents, said&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"'Monsieur le Recteur, we want not this
money.  The pay of His Majesty, whom God
and St. Louis long preserve! secures us in all
that a soldier requires; but the poor, though
they are the children of God, are not so blessed.
We, the dragoons of Chartres, beg, therefore, that
you will accept of this for their use, and put it
to the common stock for the aged and the
indigent.'"
</p>

<p>
"And this soldier was named Raoul?" said
Quentin, who felt something like a shock when
he heard him mentioned.
</p>

<p>
"So the newspapers said," replied Warriston.
</p>

<p>
Quentin was silent, but the face of one of the
dead dragoons whom he had seen at Herreruela&mdash;he
who had been dragged by his stirrup&mdash;came
vividly to memory; while, such is the effect of
fancy, the moidores that remained in his pocket
seemed to become heavy as lead.
</p>

<p>
The hour was late now, and he was completely
overcome by fatigue.  With a knapsack for a
pillow he dropped asleep, while his more hardy
comrades sat smoking and drinking, and discussing
the fortune of the coming struggle in Spain.
</p>

<p>
As the light of the watch-fire waned and fell
in flickering gleams on his features, they seemed
pinched, pale, and wan.
</p>

<p>
"God help the poor fatherless boy," said
Captain Warriston, with considerable emotion;
"what hard fate brings him here?  He seems
quite a waif among us, and one that is hardly
used by you fellows of the 25th in particular.
I wish I had him with me in the Scots Brigade.
This last devilish piece of duty has broken him
completely down!"
</p>

<p>
"No, no, Warriston; there is good stuff in
him yet," said Rowland Askerne, as he divested
his broad shoulders of his own ample cloak, and
kindly spread it over the sleeper.  "At his age,
I had neither father nor mother nor friend to do
<i>this</i> for me, and I too was, like him, a poor
volunteer!"

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Sir John Horn's division continued to march by
the strong old frontier town of Elvas, which
crowns a rocky hill not far from where the
Guadiana sweeps south towards the sea.
</p>

<p>
"To-morrow," said Monkton, as he placed the
glaring red cockade of Ferdinand VII. on his
shako, "we shall be airing our most dulcet Spanish
in Old Castile, learning to dance the bolero, to
tilt up our legs in the fandango, and to twangle
on the guitar."
</p>

<p>
"I fear, Dick, that Marshal Soult will cut out
more serious work for us," said Major Middleton.
</p>

<p>
"Do we halt at Elvas?" asked some one, as
the regiment approached the town.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, thank Heaven!" exclaimed Monkton.
</p>

<p>
"We have marched twenty miles to-day, and
to-night I am going to the camp of the 28th."
</p>

<p>
"On duty?"
</p>

<p>
"No; but because they have fallen in with a
cask of whisky."
</p>

<p>
"Whisky!" exclaimed several voices.  "Whisky here?"
</p>

<p>
"The best Farintosh.  It was taken from the
wreck of a Scotch transport in Maciera Bay, and,
may I never see morning, if I don't beg, borrow,
or steal at least a canteenful.  The Slashers
won't refuse me, I am sure."
</p>

<p>
Next morning, a march of ten miles brought
them in sight of the great castle of Badajoz&mdash;that
place of terrible but immortal memory!
</p>

<p>
Flanked by the waters of the Rivollas and
Guadiana, flowing between vineyards and olive
groves, it towered in clear sharp outline against
the pure blue sky, on cliffs three hundred feet in
height, with all its grim batteries and tiers of
cannon bristling, row on row; its eight great
bastions, each standing forth with one angle
bathed in strong yellow sunlight, and the other
sunk in deep purple shadow; the rich gothic
spires and countless pinnacles of its churches and
convents, and the glittering casements of its
white-walled mansions that clustered on its rocky
steep, all shining in the warm glow, while, in the
background, extended far away the long green
wavy outline of the mountains of Toledo.
</p>

<p>
Kellerman and Victor had alike been foiled
before it, as the Portuguese had been in the days
of the Archduke John of Austria, and now the
scarlet and yellow banners of King Ferdinand
VII. were still waving triumphantly upon the towers of
San Cristoval, San Roque, and the Forts of
Picurina and Pardaleras.  The united clangour of,
perhaps, five hundred bells, mellowed by the
distance, came merrily upon the morning breeze, a
welcome to the British.  Then a white puff of
smoke from the highest battery of the grand old
citadel announced the first gun of a royal salute.
Another and another followed, flashing from the
dark embrasures, while the pale wreaths curled
upward and floated away, till the whole round of
twenty-one pieces was complete; but, as the city
was two miles distant, each report came faintly to
the ear, and at an interval after the flash.
</p>

<p>
Ere long, the twenty-eight arches of the noble
bridge of the Guadiana rang beneath the hoofs
of our Light Dragoons, as the advanced guard
began to cross, and, amid the clangour of bells in
spire and campanile, and the "vivas" of the
assembled thousands, the reiterated shouts of
"Viva los Ingleses!" "Viva los Escotos!" the
infantry found themselves defiling through the
lower streets of Badajoz and entering Spain.
</p>

<p>
Eyes dark and bright sparkled with pleasure
and welcome from many an open lattice, and
many a fan and veil were waved, and many a
white hand kissed to the passing troops, as, with
colours waving and bayonets fixed, they passed
under the gaily crowded balconies on their way to
the Guadiana.
</p>

<p>
Escorted by a guard of glittering Spanish
lancers, mounted on beautiful jennets, a quaint
old coach, such as we only see depicted in fairy
tales or pantomimes, came slowly rumbling
forward on its carved and gilded wheels.  It was
gorgeous with burnished brasses and coats
armorial, but was shaped like a gigantic apple pie,
drawn by six sleek fat mules, that were almost
hidden under their elaborate trappings; and each pair
had a little lean dark postilion, in cocked-hat and
epaulettes, floundering away in boots like
water-buckets, while, at the doors on both sides, hung
two tripod stools, as the means of ingress and
egress.
</p>

<p>
But, in front of this remarkable conveyance,
the advanced guard halted with carbine on thigh,
the officers saluting and the trumpets sounding,
while the general and staff approached bare-headed,
with hat in hand, for in the recesses of
this apple-pie were the most Reverend Padres en
Dios, the Archbishop of Santiago, the Bishop
Suffragan of Compostella, Senores the Captain-general,
the Alcalde of Badajoz, and a great many
more, in civic robes and military uniforms, with
crosses and medals, and all of these persons
clambered out of the interior, and descended on terra
firma by means of the three-legged stools aforesaid,
coach-steps being as yet unknown in the realms
of his Most Catholic majesty.
</p>

<p>
"Well," said Monkton, "this turn-out beats
all the buggies I ever saw.  By Jove! it is like
Noah's ark on wheels.  Such a team it would be
to 'tool' to Epsom with!"
</p>

<p>
We shall skip the long and solemn, the flattering
and bombastic speeches made by the Spanish
officials, and the curt but manly responses given by
the British on this auspicious occasion.  Suffice it
to say that, after a brief halt, the division
continued its route by easy marches.  The green hill
of Albuera&mdash;the scene of a glorious battle three
years after&mdash;ere long became visible on the right
flank; but the day passed without any tidings
being heard of the guerillas of Don Baltasar de
Saldos, a circumstance which, in the course of
conversation with Buckle the adjutant, the Master
of Rohallion contrived that Quentin should know.
Naturally he felt anxious about the matter, and
feared in his heart that perhaps he had personally
something to do with the non-appearance of
this famous partisan chief.
</p>

<p>
Twenty-four miles beyond Badajoz brought
the division, with all the heavy artillery of the
army, to Montijo, a little town of Estremadura,
where a camp was formed for the night near the
Guadiana.
</p>

<p>
As contrasted with "the Granary of Portugal,"
through which they had latterly passed, the
barrenness of wasted and long-neglected Estremadura
impressed all with poor ideas of Spain.
</p>

<p>
"The great Conde was right," said Warriston,
as the little group of the other evening assembled
again, in nearly a similar manner, to sup by their
watchfire, which was lighted near a deserted
pottery in a field where the Indian corn had grown
and been reaped; "right indeed, when he said
if you wish to know what actual want is, carry
on a war in Spain!"
</p>

<p>
"And the comforts of a Peninsular tour like
ours are in no way enhanced when one's exchequer
is low," said Monkton.
</p>

<p>
"True, Willie, and there is a wonderful sympathy
between the animal spirits and the breeches-pocket."
</p>

<p>
"And I, for one, can show 'a regular soldier's
thigh,' my purse has long since collapsed."
</p>

<p>
"Line it with these, Monkton," said Quentin,
slipping a half-dozen moidores into his hand.
</p>

<p>
"What are these?&mdash;moidores, by the gods of
the Greeks!  But thanks, my friend, I shall pay
you at San Pedro, where I shall bring our paymaster
to book.  I could lavish a colonel's pay,
if I had it, which is never likely to be the case,
for we're a devilish slow regiment, Quentin."
</p>

<p>
"But some of our Highland corps are slower
still," remarked an officer.
</p>

<p>
"I have known a fellow to be four years an
ensign in one of them, and every month at least
once under fire all the time," said Askerne.
</p>

<p>
"They never sell out or purchase in, and then
there is no killing them by bullets, starvation, or
fatigue."
</p>

<p>
"For the baggage guard to-morrow, Mr. Monkton,"
said old Sergeant-major Calder, approaching
the group, who were lounging on the
grass; "for the colours, Mr. Hardinge and Mr. Boyle."
</p>

<p>
He saluted and retired, while Monkton apostrophized
the baggage guard in pretty round terms.
</p>

<p>
"I should like to have halted one night at
Badajoz," said Colville; "there is a theatre there,
and other means of spending money which smack
of civilization.  Conyers&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Who's he?"
</p>

<p>
"Conyers of the 10th Hussars, one of Hope's
extra aides-de-camp, says there are some beautiful
girls to be seen on the promenade of poplars, the
Prado beside the river, in the evening, where they
all go veiled, with fireflies strung in their hair,
producing a very singular effect."
</p>

<p>
"I would rather be whispering soft nothings
into their pretty ears and over their white
shoulders than be bivouacking here," said Monkton.
</p>

<p>
"I believe you, my friend; but perhaps the
knife of some devil of a lover or <i>cortejo</i> might give
your whisperings a point you never expected,"
replied Askerne.
</p>

<p>
"Try a sip from my canteen," said Monkton;
"it contains some of the stuff I got the other
night at the camp of the 28th, and better you'll
find it than the aguardiente of the Spanish
Hottentots.  Take a pull, Quentin, as a nightcap, and
then turn in under that laurel bush and sleep if
you can, under your own bays, till the bugle
sounds the 'rouse.'"
</p>

<p>
Remembering the injunctions of the worthy
Padre Florez, Quentin declined.
</p>

<p>
"Well, well, boy, as you please," said Monkton,
slinging his canteen behind him; "but what
the devil's that?  Cavalry!"
</p>

<p>
"It is the staff&mdash;the general," exclaimed
Askerne, as they all started to their feet, and
proceeded to buckle on their swords, as Sir John
Hope, with several mounted staff officers and
commanders of corps, among whom was Colonel
Cosmo Crawford, approached slowly, checking
their horses, and talking with considerable animation,
while their flowing scarlet and white plumes,
their cocked-hats, aiguilettes, and orders, the
holsters, and housings of their horses, were all
visible in the glare of the watchfire, on which the
servants and pioneers were heaping fresh branches
for the night, and the occasional flashes of which
brought out in strong light or threw into deep
shadow the martial group, imparting a
Rembrandtish tone to the horses and their riders.
</p>

<p>
"What is this you say, Conyers?" Sir John
was heard to ask; "repeat it to Colonel Crawford
of the 25th.  You bring us&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Most serious intelligence, sir," replied
Conyers, who wore the blue and scarlet of the 10th
Hussars, and who seemed flushed and excited by
a long ride.  "I have just come on the spur from
Badajoz, and there tidings have reached the
Captain-general that yesterday the Spaniards, under
Don Joachim Blake, were again completely
discomfited at Espinosa, and that the Estremaduran
army, which was beaten the day before at Gamonal,
is demoralized or cut to pieces; and that the first,
second, and fourth corps of the French army,
seventy thousand strong, are free to act in any
quarter."
</p>

<p>
"First, second, and fourth&mdash;these are the corps
of Victor, BessiÃ¨res, and Lefebre."
</p>

<p>
"Exactly, Sir John."
</p>

<p>
"If they march against us, the whole siege
and field artillery of the army may be lost!"
exclaimed Hope.
</p>

<p>
"Nor is this all, sir," continued the aide-de-camp,
speaking rapidly and with growing excitement;
"the movement made by the guerillas of
Baltasar de Saldos towards the hill of Albuera,
to cover our advance, has been anticipated!"
</p>

<p>
"<i>Anticipated!</i>"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Sir John."
</p>

<p>
"How, how?" asked several voices.
</p>

<p>
"General de Ribeaupierre with his whole
brigade, consisting of the 24th Chasseurs Ã  Cheval,
the Westphalian Light Horse, numbering five
hundred and sixty sabres, and the Dragoons of
Napoleon, five hundred strong, aided by Laborde's
corps and some field guns, issued from Valencia
de Alcantara, attacked the guerillas in a valley
near San Vincente, and captured their five pieces
of artillery, killing the Conde de Maciera, a
captain of Lancers, who made three charges to retake
them; so De Saldos informs the Captain-general at
Badajoz, that there must be treachery somewhere."
</p>

<p>
"Treachery," reiterated the general, while Cosmo
Crawford put his glass to his eye and glanced
with a malicious smile towards the group where
Quentin, with others, stood listening to all this
with the deepest interest, for until the "Courier,"
or some English paper reached them, they were
often ignorant for months of what was enacted in
other parts of Spain.
</p>

<p>
"Don Baltasar is on the march, however, to join
us," resumed Captain Conyers; "he has made a
detour by the left bank of the Valverde, and by
to-morrow evening hopes to make his report to
you in person."
</p>

<p>
"I thank you, Captain Conyers," said the
general; "come, gentlemen, this is not so bad
after all!  To-morrow night we halt at Merida."
</p>

<p>
"Had you not better despatch a message to
De Saldos, saying so," suggested an officer.
</p>

<p>
"My horse is used up, sir," said Captain
Conyers, smiling; "he has gone forty-five miles,
on a feed of chopped whin, over the most infernal
roads too!"
</p>

<p>
"There is that young volunteer of ours," said
Cosmo; "he acquitted himself so well before, Sir
John&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"That we should give him an opportunity of
doing so again," interrupted the lieutenant-general.
</p>

<p>
"A good idea!" muttered some of the staff.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Kennedy," said Cosmo, beckoning forward
the anxious listener; "a message saying
where we shall halt to-morrow is to be despatched
to the guerilla De Saldos; you will, of course,
only be too happy to bear it?"
</p>

<p>
"I beg most respectfully to decline, sir,"
said Quentin, emphatically, and with growing
anger.
</p>

<p>
"What the devil, sirrah?" Cosmo was beginning.
</p>

<p>
"Ha&mdash;indeed, and wherefore?" asked the
general.
</p>

<p>
"I am scarcely able to keep up with the regiment,
General Hope," replied Quentin; "I have
been seriously ill, and am more fit for hospital
than for duty."
</p>

<p>
The general knit his brows, and Cosmo dealt
Quentin, through his eyeglass, a glance of cool
scrutiny, that deepened into withering scorn or
hate without alloy.
</p>

<p>
"Very well, we must send an orderly dragoon,"
said Sir John Hope, turning away.
</p>

<p>
"Take care, Mr. Kennedy," said Cosmo, "lest
at a future time this refusal may be remembered
against you to your disadvantage."
</p>

<p>
"Crawford doesn't like you, Quentin," said
Askerne, after the staff rode away; "it is a great
pity, for, though cold and haughty, he is a brave
and good officer."
</p>

<p>
"Damme, don't scoff at the service, Askerne,"
said Monkton, with mock severity.
</p>

<p>
Poor Quentin had a heavy heart that night;
we are not sure that he did not shed some bitter
and unavailing tears, for the forebodings of coming
evil banished sleep when he most needed it, and
crushed the soul within him.
</p>

<p>
But his comrades as usual sat long by the
watch-fire, passing the night with song, jest, and
anecdote.  They had neither care for the present nor
fear for the future, and their jollity formed a
strong contrast to his forlorn sadness.
</p>

<p>
"I think we should now turn in," said Monkton;
"we march betimes to-morrow; to your
tents, O Borderers!  But what the deuce is that?"
</p>

<p>
"The <i>gÃ©nÃ©rale</i>," said Colville.
</p>

<p>
"Already!"
</p>

<p>
"Already, Monkton; and there sounds the gathering
of the Gordons in the streets of Montijo."
</p>

<p>
"The nights are very short in the
Penin-in-insula," said Monkton, scrambling up and making
several attempts to buckle his belt.
</p>

<p>
"You'll have to sober yourself on the march,
Willie," said Askerne, giving him a rough shake.
</p>

<p>
"By Jove! to have to fall in when one should
go to sleep&mdash;to nod and drowse and dream while
tramping on and on, your nose coming every
minute down on the tin canteen or the knapsack
of the man in front of you!  It is miserable
work; but what with contract powder that won't
explode, ammunition shoes warranted not to last,
diseased bullocks shot while at fever heat and
eaten half raw, we are little likely to beat the
French, either in fighting or marching."
</p>

<p>
"Unless, like them, we learn to hang an occasional
commissary or contractor," said old Middleton,
as he sprang with agility on his horse;
and the regiment formed open column of companies
in the dark, for daybreak was yet an hour
distant.

CHAPTER VII.

RETROGRESSION.

<p class="intropoem">
  "Lucius, the horsemen are returned from viewing<br />
  The number, strength, and posture of our foes,<br />
  Who now encamp within a short hour's march.<br />
  On the high point of yonder western tower,<br />

</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Ere noon next day, while the division was
traversing the grassy plain amid which lies the
ancient city of Merida, the sound of distant firing
on their right flank announced the repulse, by the
guerillas, of some of the cavalry of Laborde's
corps, when making a reconnoissance.  The light
white puffs of the musketry that curled along the
green hill-sides, came nearer and nearer, and it
soon became known that the band of the formidable
De Saldos el Estudiente, above two thousand
strong, had joined the division of Sir John Hope;
as the newspaper of Lord Rohallion had it, a
measure fully arranged "by the skill and
courage" of our young volunteer.  But though the
army continued its march for several days, no
recognition of his service, in orders or otherwise,
ever reached him from head-quarters, and happily
for himself, he saw nothing of the dreaded Baltasar,
who fortunately was left in the rear, with
an open sabre cut.
</p>

<p>
Ribeaupierre's cavalry brigade abandoned
Valencia de Alcantara without firing a shot, on its
flank being turned, and fell back, no one knew
exactly where or in what direction.
</p>

<p>
Hope's division halted at Merida, a place
eminently calculated to excite the deepest interest
in the thinking or historical visitor, by its
ancient remains; its great bridge of more than
eighty arches spanning the broad waters of the
Guadiana; the ruins of its Roman castle, which
Alfonso the Astrologer gifted to the knights of
Santiago, and in the vaults of which Baltasar's
guerillas had thrust some unfortunate French
prisoners; its triumphal arch of Julius CÃ¦sar,
under which the division passed with drums beating
and colours flying, and its crumbling
amphitheatre:&mdash;Merida, of old the Rome of Spain, and
the home of the aged and disabled soldiers of
the 5th and 10th legions of Augustus CÃ¦sar,
whose great pyramid still towers there, amid the
ruins of its contemporaries.
</p>

<p>
There was ample accommodation in the town
for the officers of the division; but yet not enough
to prevent a dispute about rank, or precedence,
or something else, between a Captain Winton of
the Borderers, and an officer of the German
Legion.  So they met about daybreak near the
Baths of Diana.  The former was attended by
Askerne of the Grenadiers, and the latter by
Major Burgwesel of his own corps, and at the
second fire Winton shot his man dead, Cosmo
coolly lending his pistols for this occasion,
without comment or inquiry, either of which would
have been ungentlemanly, according to the temper
or spirit of the service then.
</p>

<p>
Prior to this event, on the evening the division
halted, Quentin, about the hour of sunset, had
wandered to the old Roman aqueduct which lies
near the city, and he remained for a time lost in
thought while surveying its mouldering arches,
and the piles of columns, bases, flowered capitals,
enriched friezes, Corinthian entablatures, and
broken statues, lying amid the weeds and long
grass, the remains of the once superb temples,
ruined by the Goths and Moors; and perhaps he
was thinking of his old dominie at Rohallion, and
the worthy pedant's profound veneration for the
ancient days of Rome, the mistress of all the
then known world.
</p>

<p>
The place was solitary and almost buried amid
old vineyards and groves of now leafless trees.
Under one of the mouldering arches, from which,
notwithstanding the lateness of the season, masses
of luxuriant creepers and trailers were yet hanging,
Quentin, leaning on his musket, lingered to
admire the scenery and the glory of the golden
sunset, which spread its farewell radiance over
the vast plain, of which Merida, from its
situation on a lofty eminence, commands a view in
every direction&mdash;the olive groves yet green and
waving in the breeze, and the winding Guadiana,
while far away in distance, all tinted in dusky
blue or russet brown, but edged with flaming
gold, stretched the mountain sierras, range over
range, towards the north.
</p>

<p>
From the pleasant contemplation of this evening
landscape he was suddenly roused by seeing
a pair of fierce dark eyes glaring into his own.
</p>

<p>
It was the guerilla Trevino, of whom it seems
a mockery to give his once prefix of Padre!
</p>

<p>
"So, senor," said he, with a terrible grimace,
"we meet again, do we?"
</p>

<p>
"It seems so, senor," replied Quentin, haughtily,
as he stepped back a pace, "and what then?"
</p>

<p>
"Only that I find you in very bad company."
</p>

<p>
"I am alone, senor."
</p>

<p>
"Well, and you alone form the company I
refer to," replied the Spaniard, insolently, and
with a savage grin, while the fingers of his right
hand clutched the haft of his knife, and his thumb
was firmly planted on the pommel.  There was
no mistaking this action or his air for anything
else than open hostility, so Quentin warily stepped
back another pace, and glanced hastily round to
be assured that no other guerillas were lurking near,
and then grasping the barrel of his musket, which
was unloaded, he stood ready on his defence against
an antagonist who possessed, perhaps, twice his
bodily strength.
</p>

<p>
"What do you mean, Senor Trevino, by
accosting me in this manner?" he demanded.
</p>

<p>
"I mean, <i>hombre</i>, that I have been lately at
the Convent of Sant Engracia, and that Donna
Isidora has <i>not</i> been heard of there; so, in the
meantime, I and two or three others have sworn
across our knives to kill you, that is all; leaving
to time to reveal what you have done with her."
</p>

<p>
Something of this kind was what Quentin had
long dreaded; but disdaining any attempt to
explain or expostulate, and exasperated by the
injustice to which he was subjected, he clutched
his musket and said sternly&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Stand back, fellow!"
</p>

<p>
"Ha! <i>perro y ladron</i> (dog and thief)&mdash;you
will have it, then!"
</p>

<p>
With head stooped, body crouching, and knife
drawn, the Spaniard was springing like a tiger
upon Quentin, when the brass butt of Brown Bess,
swung by no sparing or erring hand, fell full on
his left temple, from whence it slid very unpleasantly
down on his collar-bone, and tumbled him
bleeding and senseless on the ground.
</p>

<p>
After this, Quentin, who was in no mood to
feel any compunction about the affair, turned and
left him to recover as he might, resolving, until
in a more secure neighbourhood, not to indulge
his taste for the picturesque or antique, and
feeling exceeding thankful that he had not left
his musket as usual in his tent.
</p>

<p>
"You were just in time, sir," said a voice, as
Quentin turned to leave the ruined aqueduct;
"an instant later and that Spanish thief had put
his knife into you."
</p>

<p>
The speaker was Allan Grange, of the 25th,
who, stooping down, took from Trevino's relaxed
hand his knife, a very ugly pig-butcher-like
weapon.  A guerilla, doubtless some friend of
Trevino's, was hastening forward at this moment,
but on seeing Quentin joined by a comrade he
drew back a little way, and so the affair ended
for the time; but this was not the last that
Quentin was fated to hear of the encounter.
</p>

<p>
By the ruinous town of Medellin (the birthplace
of the conqueror of Mexico), where the
Guadiana was fabled of old to rise, after running
twenty miles under ground; by the wretched town
of Miajadas, and by Truxillo, with its feudal
towers and Moorish walls, when the French had
ruined alike the house in which Pizarro was
born and the noble palace of the Conde de
Lopesa, the division continued its march amid
rough and stormy weather, and, after passing
Talavera de la Reyna&mdash;so called from the queen
of Alonzo XI., to distinguish it from other places
of the same name&mdash;halted, on the 22nd day of
November, at the Escurial, that magnificent
palace, twenty-five miles from Madrid, built by
Philip II. in commemoration of the battle of
St. Quentin, a holy personage, to whom he solemnly
dedicated it.
</p>

<p>
With his regiment, our hero bivouacked outside
the little village of Escurial de Abajo.  The night
was a fearful one of storm.  Over the bare and
desolate country the winter wind swept in
tempestuous gusts and the rain fell in torrents,
swelling all the streams of the Guadarama&mdash;for
the weather was completely broken now.
</p>

<p>
In that horrible bivouac poor Quentin lost his
blanket&mdash;his whole household furniture.  Near
him lay a soldier's wife with a sick infant; he
spread it over both and left it with them; when
the regiment shifted its ground next day the
mother and child dropped by the wayside, so
Quentin never saw them or his blanket again.
</p>

<p>
Here, as Sir John Moore had foreseen, and as
General Hope had stated his fears to Cosmo, the
enemy did <i>press forward</i> from Valladolid and
Tordesillas, and the advanced posts of their
cavalry being reported in sight, strong guards
were posted and picquets thrown forward in front
of the Escurial.
</p>

<p>
This forward movement of the French threatened
to cut off Hope's communication with Sir
John Moore, who was then at Salamanca, and
might lose his artillery.
</p>

<p>
To prevent this, and effect a junction with the
main body under the general, Hope marched from
the Escurial on the 27th of November, and
crossed the long and lofty mountain chain of the
Guadarama, the cliffs of which are so steep that
the Spaniards of old likened them to straight
spindles.  Moving by Villa Castin, a market-town
at their base, he halted at Avila, on the
right bank of the Ajada, where Quentin was billeted
in the same house with Monkton, in that dark
and narrow street in which the spiritual Maria
Theresa was born&mdash;"<i>Nuestra Serifica Madre</i>,"
as she is named by the old Castilians.
</p>

<p>
The enemy's light cavalry were still pressing
on, and at times their carbines were heard
popping in the distance, when responding to our
skirmishers.  It was the gloomy morning of the
first day of December; the rain was still falling
in torrents, and the sky looked dark and louring.
</p>

<p>
Save an occasional exchange of shots between
outposts and petty skirmishes, nothing of interest
had taken place with the enemy, and the toil of
this retrograde movement dispirited the troops.
Even Monkton, one of the most heedless men in
the regiment, was sullen and spiritless.  Wearied
by their long march, he and Quentin sat in their
bare and miserable billet, silent and moody.  It
was in the house of a hatter, or maker of
sombreros, facing the dark and narrow street, which
was overshadowed by a gigantic parish church,
the bells of which were ringing in honour of the
British, and their notes came mournfully on the
passing gusts of wind.
</p>

<p>
It was indeed a wild evening in Avila.  The
rain was pouring down in one uniform and ceaseless
sheet, the wind bellowing in the thoroughfares
with a melancholy sound, and the swollen
Ajada was boiling in foam against the piers of its
ancient bridge.
</p>

<p>
A miserable meal of tough beef, boiled with a
little rice in a pipkin, had been served up by
Monkton's servant, a poor half-starved fellow,
whose single shirt had long since been reduced to
its collar and wristbands, whose red coat showed
innumerable darns and patches, and who now
regretted the days when he forsook his plough on
Tweedside to become a soldier.  With their feet
planted on a brasero of charcoal, cloaks muffled
about them for warmth, and cigars in their
mouths, our two warriors ruefully surveyed the
bare whitewashed walls of their room, and then
looked at each other.
</p>

<p>
"Rain, rain!" exclaimed Monkton; "what an
infernal climate!  And this is the land of grapes
and sunshine!  I've never seen such drops since
I was in the West Indies with our flank
companies, at the capture of Martinique."
</p>

<p>
At that moment, amid the lashing of the rain
on wall and window, the roar of the wind, and
the rush of the gorged gutters, the tramp of a
horse was heard, and the voice of Buckle, who
was brigade-adjutant for the day, was heard
shouting&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Fall in, the outlying picquets of the 1st
brigade&mdash;sound bugle!"
</p>

<p>
But his voice and the half-strangled bugle
notes were alike borne away by the tempest.
</p>

<p>
A heavy malediction escaped Monkton.  This
worthy sub had puffed at his fragrant Havannah
till he had smoked himself into such a soothed
state that he was quite indisposed "to be bothered
about anything or anybody," as he said; and
now he remembered that on halting the
sergeant-major had warned him for out-picquet.
</p>

<p>
He sprang up and kicked the brasero aside,
sending the smouldering charcoal flying right and
left.
</p>

<p>
"Out-picquet!" he exclaimed, "and the rain
coming down in bucketfuls!  Damme, who would
be a soldier abroad, while there are chimneys
to sweep at home?"
</p>

<p>
A smart single knock now came to the door, as
he belted his sword beneath his cloak.
</p>

<p>
"Come in&mdash;is that you, sergeant-major?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir," said old Norman Calder, who was
muffled in his grey great-coat, which, as he said,
"smoked like a killogie."
</p>

<p>
"Where are these infernal picquets parading?"
</p>

<p>
"I've just come to show you, sir; they are
falling in under the arcades opposite the Bishop's
palace, where the staff are quartered.  Fresh
ammunition has just been served out to all."
</p>

<p>
"That looks like work."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir; the enemy's cavalry are in force
upon the road towards Villa Castin, in our rear."
</p>

<p>
"We have heard little else since we fell back
from the Escurial."
</p>

<p>
As a volunteer is always the first man for any
perilous duty, Quentin buttoned his great-coat
over his accoutrements and musket, and set out
to join Monkton's picquet, which Buckle was
parading, with several others, under some quaint
old arcades of stone, above which the houses,
with broad balconies and rich entablatures,
remnants of the days when Avila was rich and
flourishing, rose to a considerable height.
</p>

<p>
The daylight was nearly gone now, and already
the half-drenched and half-fed soldiers looked
pale and weary.
</p>

<p>
"As the weather has been frequently wet, and
as the duty of to-night is an important one, you
will be careful, gentlemen, to inspect the arms,
flints, and ammunition of your picquets," said
Buckle; "and as the prickers may not be deemed
sufficient to indicate the state of the touch-holes,
the butts will be brought to the front."
</p>

<p>
"Butts to the front," an order then in use,
was given by Monkton and each officer in succession,
after which the ranks were opened, and every
man blew down the barrel of his musket, so that
by applying a hand to the touch-hole the real state
of the vent was ascertained by the inspector.
</p>

<p>
"Handle arms&mdash;with ball cartridge, prime,
and load&mdash;secure arms!" followed rapidly, and
away went the out-picquets, double-quick, through
rain and mire, wind and storm, to their several
posts, Monkton's being a mile and a half beyond
the bridge of the Ajada, in tolerably open ground,
interspersed with groups of little trees.
</p>

<p>
Under one of these he sheltered his picquet,
and two hundred yards in front of it posted his
line of sentinels, with orders not to walk to and
fro, but to stand steadily on their posts, to look
straight to their front, to fire on all who could
not give the countersign, and to keep up a regular
communication with each other and with those of
the picquets on both flanks; and then each man
was left for his solitary hour, the time allotted
for such duty when in front of an enemy.
</p>

<p>
About daybreak, after a short nap in the
thicket, and after imbibing a sip from his canteen
of rum grog&mdash;the last of its contents&mdash;Quentin
found himself on this solitary but important duty,
posted on the centre of the highway, gazing
steadily into the murky obscurity before him,
and thanking Heaven in his heart that the rain
had ceased, and that the cold and biting
December wind was passing away.

<h3>
CHAPTER VIII.
<br /><br />
A MESSAGE FROM THE ENEMY.
</h3>

<p class="intropoem">
  "'Tis true, unruffled and serene I've met<br />
  The common accidents of life, but here<br />
  Such an unlooked-for storm of ills falls on me<br />
  It beats down all my strength&mdash;I cannot bear it."<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ADDISON.<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
This was not the first occasion on which Quentin
had enacted the part of sentinel; but never
had he done so with the knowledge that the
enemy was before him, and perhaps at that
moment closer than he had any idea of, among
the mist that obscured the landscape.
</p>

<p>
All was quiet in front and rear; save the drip
of the last night's rain from an over-charged leaf,
or the croaking of the bull-frogs in a marsh close
by, not a sound broke the stillness.
</p>

<p>
The dull grey winter morning stole slowly in;
the distant mountain peaks of the Guadarama
grew red, but all else remained opaque and dim,
save the jagged summits of that lofty <i>sierra</i>&mdash;a
Spanish word very descriptive of a range of conical
hills, being evidently (as we are informed by a
letter of the dominie) derived from <i>serra</i>, the
Latin word for a saw.
</p>

<p>
On the slope of a hill, at a little distance from
where Quentin stood, was a gibbet, a strong post
about twenty feet high, having two horizontal
beams crosswise on its summit, and from these
four arms there hung four robbers, each by the
neck, and their long black hair waved over their
faces as they swung slowly to and fro in the
morning wind, with the ravens wheeling around
them, and perching on the arms of the gibbet.
</p>

<p>
The bull-frogs in the marsh croaked vigorously,
and like every other place in Spain, even this
fetid swamp had its legend; for here it was that
the Cid, Rodrigo de Bivar, when proceeding at
the head of twenty young and brave hidalgoes,
on a pilgrimage to the shrine of Saint James at
Compostella, saw an aged and half-naked leper in
the midst of the slough.  Leaping from his horse,
Rodrigo dragged the poor man forth, and to the
wrath and disgust of his mail-shirted companions,
seated him on his own charger, Babieca; thereafter
he set him at table with them, and finally,
in the extremity of his humility and Christian
charity, shared his bed with him.  In the night
the cavalier awoke, and beheld the leper
standing on a cloud above his bed, midway
between the floor and ceiling, surrounded by a
blaze of light and clad in white and shining
robes; and ere he vanished he informed the Cid
that he was Saint Lazarus, who had taken the
form of a leper to test his charity, which was so
commendable that God had granted he should
prosper in all things, but chiefly in his wars against
the infidel dogs who were troubling all Spain.
</p>

<p>
As the mists drew upward, Quentin could see
about half a mile distant in front, a line of French
cavalry videttes, each sitting motionless in his
saddle, and both horse and rider looking like one
huge and mis-shapen figure, as the scarlet cloak
of the latter was spread over the crupper of his
charger behind him.
</p>

<p>
While gazing steadily and with deep interest
at the enemy, he was somewhat surprised to see
two French dragoons suddenly ride from their own
lines straight along the road towards his post.
</p>

<p>
That they were deserters&mdash;his first idea&mdash;was
impossible, as they rode leisurely and were not
fired on by their picquets.  By their light green
uniforms and brass helmets with flowing plumes he
soon saw that they were Chasseurs Ã  Cheval, and
that one, who rode a few paces in front of the other,
was an officer, with a white handkerchief tied as an
extempore flag of truce to the point of his sabre.
</p>

<p>
Monkton, and the main body of the picquet,
were rather beyond hail, and for a minute Quentin
was irresolute what to do; but before he could
decide upon anything, the officer came fairly up
to him, and checking his horse on the bit, said
in tolerable English&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Monsieur le soldat, we have come hither on
an errand of mercy.  An old and valued officer of
our corps is sinking under the fatigue of last night
and the suffering incident to an old wound, so we
have ridden over to see if there is not at least
one brave and generous man among you, who
will give us a mouthful of eau-de-vie or any other
spirit to keep him alive; for though our surgeons
order this, <i>sangdieu</i>, we haven't a drop in the
whole brigade."
</p>

<p>
The interchange of many civilities, wine,
biscuits, tobacco, and newspapers, frequently took
place between our outposts and the French during
the Peninsular wars.  To such a length was this
eventually carried, that they frequently went over
to smoke at each other's watchfires; but a very
stringent order of the Duke of Wellington put a
stop to these visits.
</p>

<p>
Before the speaker had concluded his singular
request, Quentin had time to recognise in him
the French lieutenant whom he had so signally
befriended at Herreruela.
</p>

<p>
"Monsieur de Ribeaupierre," said he, "don't
you remember me?"
</p>

<p>
"<i>Parbleu!</i> yes&mdash;this is fortunate, my friend,"
said the other, grasping Quentin's hand; "I am
glad to see you again, but not with the musket
still&mdash;what! no promotion yet?"
</p>

<p>
"I am still but a volunteer."
</p>

<p>
"Ah&mdash;you should serve the emperor!"
</p>

<p>
"And then, we have not yet fought a battle."
</p>

<p>
"Had you not fallen back so rapidly on our
advance from Valladolid and Tordesillas, we should
have had the pleasure of capturing and escorting
you all to France."
</p>

<p>
"Thanks for your good intentions."
</p>

<p>
"I still hope to see them carried out," said
Ribeaupierre, laughing; "but here come some of
your people," he added, waving his handkerchief,
as Monkton, who had witnessed this interview,
came hurrying forward, with his sergeant, and a
section of the picquet with bayonets fixed.
</p>

<p>
Quentin rapidly acquainted Monkton with the
object of the Frenchman's visit, adding&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"He is Ribeaupierre, the French officer of whom
I told you&mdash;son of the brigadier of the same name."
</p>

<p>
"Ah&mdash;indeed; then I have much pleasure in
meeting him," said Monkton, as he and the
officer saluted each other very courteously.
</p>

<p>
On inquiry being made, it was discovered that
the sergeant of the picquet, Ewen Donaldson,
alone had any brandy, so he readily poured the
contents of his canteen into the flask of
Ribeaupierre, who, after thanking him profusely,
handed it to his orderly, saying&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Paul, mon camarade, away with this for our
patient; use your spurs, and I shall follow."
</p>

<p>
The dragoon galloped away.  Ribeauperre
offered a five-franc piece to Donaldson, who being
a gruff Scotsman, declined it so bluffly that the
young officer coloured to the peak of his helmet.
</p>

<p>
"You will join me in a cigar then, mon
camarade?" said he, politely proffering his open
cigar case.  Then saluting Monkton again, he
said, "Excuse me, monsieur l'officier, if, before
returning, I speak a word or two in your presence
with the friend to whom I owe my life&mdash;whom my
good mother remembers every night in her prayers,
for I told her of our adventures near Valencia."
</p>

<p>
"Your mother, monsieur?  Is it possible that
she is with the army at this season?"
</p>

<p>
"She is with the emperor's court at Madrid,
and hopes to see you all set sail from Lisbon.
By the way," added Ribeaupierre, with a smile of
waggery, "your lively Spanish friend, Donna
Isidora, will be quite consoled when I tell her
that I have seen you&mdash;alive and well too!  She
thinks of you with remorse and tears, as one
whom she had poisoned in mistake, she says.
How came all that to pass?  We sent a patrol
to search the Villa de Maciera for you, but no
trace of you could be found."
</p>

<p>
"Is she still in your hands?" asked Quentin,
with an expression of interest.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, monsieur," replied the other, caressing
his moustache.
</p>

<p>
"A prisoner?"
</p>

<p>
"<i>Peste</i>!  What an idea!"
</p>

<p>
"I trust you&mdash;you have treated her well and
kindly?"
</p>

<p>
"She shall answer for herself, some time
hence."
</p>

<p>
"A prisoner!  Poor Isidora!  She will be quite
inconsolable."
</p>

<p>
"Inconsolable?  Mom ami, you forget in whose
charming society she is!  We fellows of the 24th
Chasseurs are unrivalled in conversational powers
and the general art of pleasing.  She spoke of
you very often&mdash;thought you a very nice fellow&mdash;but
so quiet&mdash;so <i>triste</i>!"
</p>

<p>
Quentin was glad that Monkton, whom he did
not wish to hear all this, had gradually gone
beyond earshot.
</p>

<p>
"And she&mdash;she&mdash;&mdash;" he was beginning with
emotions of annoyance and mortification.
</p>

<p>
"Be assured that she became quite consoled
among the 24th, and now, as Madame Jules de
MarbÅ“uf, (for my comrade Jules took her off
my hands), she has learned to think that we
Frenchmen are not such bad fellows, after all."
</p>

<p>
"This is indeed news!" exclaimed Quentin;
"Isidora married&mdash;married, and to a Frenchman!"
</p>

<p>
"Ah&mdash;la belle tigresse is quite tamed now; but
<i>I</i> must begone.  <i>Ouf&mdash;peste&mdash;tonnerre de Dieu!</i>
what a night we have had, monsieur," he added
to Monkton, who again approached.  "I have
been so soaked that I felt as if the rain was
filtering through the marrow of my bones.  If you
effect your junction with M. le GÃ©nÃ©ral Moore,
I suppose we shall have the little variety of a
general action."
</p>

<p>
"It is extremely probable," replied Monkton,
smiling at the French officer's free and easy
manner.
</p>

<p>
"That will indeed be gay&mdash;we are so anxious
to measure swords with your cavalry.  Do you
know that General Foy, in one of his despatches,
attributes your accidental victories&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"<i>Accidental?</i>"
</p>

<p>
"That is the word, my friends&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"For Roleia and Vimiera&mdash;eh?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, for anything you like&mdash;Trafalgar and
the Nile, if you please."
</p>

<p>
"Well, and Foy attributes them&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"To two great elements you Anglais possess."
</p>

<p>
"Powder and pluck?"
</p>

<p>
"No&mdash;rum and ros-bif&mdash;ha, ha!  <i>Au revoir</i>&mdash;we
shall meet again," and putting spurs to his
horse, Ribeaupierre, keeping his white handkerchief
still displayed, rode across to his own lines,
turning, however, repeatedly to kiss his hand, as
his horse caracoled along.
</p>

<p>
Relieved from his post, Quentin rejoined the
main body of the picquet in the grove of trees,
where he remained apart from the men and full
of thought; for though his self-esteem was
somewhat piqued on learning that Isidora had so
easily forgot him, he was greatly pleased to hear
of her safety, and hoped that the circumstance,
when known, would relieve him from the hostility
of Baltasar and his ragamuffins, of whom he not
unnaturally had a constant dread.  These ideas
were mingled with something of amusement&mdash;that
the brother-in-law of Baltasar, the most ferocious
of Spanish patriots, should be a Frenchman!
</p>

<p>
Just as the picquets rejoined their regiments,
prior to the whole division moving from Avila,
Rowland Askerne called Quentin aside, and, with
a face expressive of extreme concern, said&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"I wish to speak particularly with you, Quentin&mdash;there
is evidently something most unpleasant
on the tapis."
</p>

<p>
"Regarding what&mdash;or who?"
</p>

<p>
"You, my friend."
</p>

<p>
"Me&mdash;how&mdash;in what way?" asked Quentin.
</p>

<p>
"Baltasar de Saldos, the guerilla, who has
been so long in the rear, wounded, has now joined
the division, and has been at the quarters of Sir
John Hope in the Bishop's palace."
</p>

<p>
"Surely, that matters nothing to me," said
Quentin, with growing anger and alarm.
</p>

<p>
"Listen.  I was in the street, speaking with
the colonel, when the general, who was bowing
out the formidable guerilla, beckoned him, and
on their meeting I heard him say&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"'The information just given me, Colonel Crawford,
by the guerilla, fully corroborates the character
you gave me at Portalegre of that young
fellow&mdash;what is his name?'
</p>

<p>
"'Kennedy.'
</p>

<p>
"'Ah, yes; you remember?'
</p>

<p>
"'Yes, Sir John,' replied the colonel, turning
rather pale, I thought, as he glanced towards me.
</p>

<p>
"'But I have spoken with Major Middleton of
yours, and unlike you, he gives him the very
highest character.  How am I to reconcile these
discrepancies?'
</p>

<p>
"Crawford then mumbled I know not what;
but it was something about a previous knowledge
of you&mdash;of old contumacy and insolence unknown
to others; then I turned away, as it was alike
impossible and improper to listen."
</p>

<p>
These tidings filled Quentin's breast with rage,
alarm, and intense mortification.  Here was a
secret enmity against which there was no
contending, bringing with it accusations of which he
knew neither the nature nor the name.
</p>

<p>
One moment he felt inclined to rush into the
presence of the general, and boldly demand to
know of what his hostile colonel had accused him;
and then there was De Saldos too!  But in
approaching Sir John Hope, he remembered that
the proper mode could only be in writing, the
letter being transmitted by the captain of the
company to which he was attached, under cover
to Cosmo, his particular enemy (who might then
forward it with such comments as he chose), for
such is the rule and etiquette of the service.
</p>

<p>
Before he could resolve on what was to be
done, while fretting and chafing in his billet, and
just as the bugles were sounding the warning for
the march, the old sergeant-major, Norman Calder,
entered, accompanied by two soldiers of the light
company, with their bayonets fixed.
</p>

<p>
The faces of his three visitors expressed
considerable compunction, for our young volunteer,
as we have said elsewhere, was a favourite with
the whole corps.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Kennedy," said Calder, "I have come
on a sorrowful errand to you; but I only obey
the orders given to me by my superior officers."
</p>

<p>
"And these orders are, sir?" demanded
Quentin, furiously.
</p>

<p>
"To disarm you and march you a close prisoner
with the quarter-guard."
</p>

<p>
"For what reason?" asked Quentin, in a faint
voice.
</p>

<p>
"I dinna ken, sir&mdash;I have only Colonel Crawford's
orders."
</p>

<p>
"Of what am I accused?"
</p>

<p>
"That is more than I can say, sir; but if you
are innocent you have nothing to fear.  Take
courage and set a stout heart to a steep brae, as
we say at home, and you may turn the flanks of
fortune yet," added the worthy old non-commissioned
officer, patting Quentin on the shoulder,
for he saw that this open and public, and most
unmerited humiliation before the entire division,
cut him to the soul, and crushed all his spirit for
the time.
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * *
</p>

<p>
The division marched about sunrise, and Quentin,
instead of being as usual with the grenadiers
of the gallant Borderers, enjoying the society of
Askerne and other officers, found himself trudging
with the quarter-guard, a special prisoner, and
kept apart from all others under a small escort,
that marched on each side of him with muskets
loaded and bayonets fixed; for not being a
commissioned officer, there could be no other arrest
for him than a close one.
</p>

<p>
And thus, with a heavy&mdash;heavy heart, full
almost to bursting with mortification and grief,
ignorant of the accusations against him and of
what was to be his fate, he marched with the
division towards the ancient city of Alva on the
Tormes, which they entered on the evening of the
4th December, and there, as they were to halt for
seven days, Quentin was informed by Lieutenant
Buckle that he was to be tried by a general court-martial.
</p>

<p>
He felt that all, indeed, was over with him now!

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;RODRIGUEZ LOBO.<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
He rapidly learned that the court-martial was in
the garrison orders to assemble on the 5th instant,
and that charges of the most serious nature,
involving, perhaps, the terrible penalty of&mdash;death,
were to be brought against him!
</p>

<p>
What sudden mystery&mdash;what inexplicable
horror was this?
</p>

<p>
On the night he entered Alva he was relieved
from the humiliation of an armed escort or guard
by the influence of Askerne and Warriston, who
both bound themselves by their parole of honour
for his appearance whenever required.  He was
thus at liberty to go about the town, but he
cared not to avail himself of it, and remained in
his quarters.
</p>

<p>
The evening of the 4th of December was dull
and gloomy.  Setting amid saffron haze and
shorn of all his beams, the lurid sun looming
large and crimson like a wondrous globe, shed a
steady light along the waters of the Tormes, a
deep stream, which there rolls under a high and
ancient bridge, that was afterwards blown up
when the British retreated from Burgos.
</p>

<p>
An old Moorish wall surrounds Alva, which
stands on the slope of a hill, and there, above its
flat-terraced mansions, rises the great palace
of the powerful Dukes of Alva and Berwick,
where Ferdinand Alvarez of Toledo, the terror
of the Low Countries and the institutor of "the
Court of Blood," first saw the light.  In an
angle of the Moorish rampart, then crumbling
in ruins, stands a high round tower of considerable
strength and antiquity.  Herein was posted
the quarter-guard of the 1st Brigade, and in an
upper chamber Quentin had his billet, and there
he sat alone, after the day's march, left to his
own reflections, and these were mournful and
gloomy enough.
</p>

<p>
The aspect of this chamber was little calculated
to raise his drooping spirit.  Almost destitute
of furniture, it was built of massive stone,
vaulted, and had three narrow windows, the sides
and horse-shoe arches of which were covered with
elaborate zigzag Moorish ornaments, arabesques,
and uncouth inscriptions, which, though he knew
it not, were texts and quotations from the Koran
in Arabic.  These had probably been gilded and
gaudily coloured once, but now were simply
coated with mouldy whitewash.  One of these
windows opened to the hill on the slope of which
stands Alva, and afforded a view of its tiled
and terraced roofs, all drenched by the recent rain.
Another faced the mountains of Leon, and the
third showed the narrow gorge through which the
red and swollen Tormes lay rolling under the
bridge; beyond which, on an eminence, were
posted a brigade of field guns and a cavalry
picquet; the horses were linked together, and the
troops cloaked.
</p>

<p>
All looked wet and dreary, dull and mournful,
and as the December sun went down beyond the
dark and purple hills where Salamanca lies, the
pipers of the 92nd played "Lochaber no more,"
their evening retreat, and this air, so sad, so slow
and wailing, as they marched along the old Moorish
wall, affected Quentin so deeply that he covered
his face with his hands and wept.
</p>

<p>
What would that fine old soldier, courtier,
and cavalier, the mirror of old-fashioned courage
and honour, Lord Rohallion, say or think, when
he heard of his disgrace?  What would Lady
Winifred&mdash;what the old quartermaster, John
Girvan? and what would the emotions of Flora
Warrender be?
</p>

<p>
Whether the charges against him were false
or true&mdash;proved or refuted&mdash;she at least would
be lost to him for ever, for his career was closed
ere it was well begun, and he felt that no other road
in life lay open to him.  He felt too, instinctively,
that Baltasar de Saldos and his sister Donna
Isidora were in some manner the secret source
of the present evil turn in his fortune; but how
or in what fashion he was yet to learn.
</p>

<p>
The phrase, that the charges involved death or
such other punishment as a court-martial might
award, was ever before him.
</p>

<p>
The vagueness of the latter recourse, rather
than the terror of the first, cut him to the heart,
as all the penalties inflicted by such a court are
severe and disgraceful.
</p>

<p>
Cosmo, he heard, had suggested that he should
be handed over to the tender mercies of the
Spanish civil authorities; but Sir John Hope
insisted that the charges were such as only a
military court could take cognizance of; so what
on earth were they?  Unconscious alike of a
mistake or crime, oh, how he longed for the time
of trial!
</p>

<p>
As the darkness of the sombre eve crept on,
its gloom was singularly in unison with his own
sombre thoughts.
</p>

<p>
Bright visions had faded away and airy bubbles
burst.  Chateaux en Espagne were no longer
tenable now!  How many gorgeous day-dreams
of glory and honour, of rank and fame, of position
in society attained by worth and merit, were now
dissolved in air!  His naturally warm, generous,
and kindly heart had become seared, callous, and
misanthropical.  Experience and the world had
tried their worst upon him, and thus, for a time,
a mere boy in years became a bitter-hearted man,
for a day dawn of a glorious ambition seemed to be
sinking prematurely into a black and stormy night.
</p>

<p>
He had seen so many new places and met such
a variety of strangers; he had been involved in
so many episodes, and had experienced so much
by land and sea, and, within a very few months,
so much seemed to have happened, that a dreamy
dubiety appeared to obscure the past; and thus
his former monotonous existence at
Rohallion&mdash;monotonous as compared with the stir of
war&mdash;came only at times with clearness, as it were
in gleams and flashes of thought and memory.
He had nothing tangible about him&mdash;not even a
lock of Flora's hair&mdash;to convince him of past
realities, or that he had ever been elsewhere than
with the 25th; and yet out of this chaos Flora's
face and figure, her eyes and expression of feature,
her identity, stood strongly forth.  Oh! there
was neither obscurity nor indistinctness there!
</p>

<p>
And now, amid his sorrow, he felt a keen
longing to write to her, under cover to John
Girvan; but then, he reflected, was such a course
honourable in him or deserved by Lord and Lady
Rohallion, who hoped to hail her one day as their
daughter-in-law?  And what mattered her regard
for him now&mdash;now, with the heavy doom of a
court-martial hanging over his head!  And yet,
if even death were to be his fate, he felt that he
would die all the more happily with the knowledge
and surety that Flora still loved him.
</p>

<p>
Deep, deep indeed were his occasional bursts
of bitterness at Cosmo; but when he remembered
that Cosmo's mother had also been a mother to
himself&mdash;when all the memory of her love for
him, her early kindness, her caresses, her kisses
on his infant brow, her increasing tenderness&mdash;came
rushing back upon him, his heart flew to his
head, and Quentin felt that even yet he could almost
forgive all the studied wrong and injustice the
narrow spirit and furious jealousy of her son now
made him suffer.  But how were the members of
the regiment or of the division to understand
all this!
</p>

<p>
Amid the reverie in which he had been indulging
in the dark, the door of the upper chamber
of the old tower opened, and two officers, in long
regimental cloaks, entered, accompanied by a
soldier with a parcel.
</p>

<p>
"Well, Quentin, old fellow&mdash;how goes it?"
said Monkton's cheerful voice.
</p>

<p>
"Cheer up, my boy," added Askerne; "before
this time to-morrow we shall have known the
worst, and it will be past.  We have brought you
a bottle of capital wine.  It is a present from Ramon
Campillo, the jolly muleteer, who came in after
the division, and leaves again, for the French lines,
I fear."
</p>

<p>
"A sly dog, who butters his bread on both
sides, likely," said Monkton; "my man has
brought you a fowl and a loaf, so we shall make
a little supper together."
</p>

<p>
"Here, boy, drink," said Askerne, when the
soldier lighted a candle, and they all looked with
commiseration upon Quentin's pale cheek and
bloodshot eyes; "I insist upon it&mdash;you seem ill
and weary."
</p>

<p>
He could perceive that both Askerne and
Monkton looked grave, earnest, and anxious, for
they knew more of the charges against him than
they cared to tell.
</p>

<p>
"At what hour does the court assemble
to-morrow?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"Ten, Kennedy."
</p>

<p>
"Who is the president?"
</p>

<p>
"Colonel Colquhoun Grant, of the King's
Light Dragoons&mdash;a hussar corps."
</p>

<p>
"Where does it meet?" asked Quentin, wearily.
</p>

<p>
"In one of the rooms of the Alva Palace.  Now
we cannot stay above ten minutes, Quentin.  We
are both in orders for the court, which of course
is a mixed one, and this visit, if known, might cost
us our commissions perhaps; but I know Monkton's
servant to be a sure fellow."
</p>

<p>
"Sure, sir," repeated the soldier, "I should
think so!  It was to <i>my</i> poor wife and child that
Mr. Kennedy&mdash;the Lord reward him for it!&mdash;gave
his blanket on the night we bivouacked at
the Escurial," added the man, in a broken voice;
"the night I lost them both&mdash;never to see them
again."
</p>

<p>
Askerne now asked Quentin many questions
concerning his recent wanderings; the answers
to some of these he jotted down in his note-book;
and he gave much good advice for his guidance
on the morrow, adding, with a sigh of annoyance,
that he feared there was a deep scheme formed
against him, and that, as several outrages had
been committed by our retreating troops, it was
not improbable that he might be sacrificed to
soothe the ruffled feelings of the Spaniards.
</p>

<p>
"What leads you to think so?" asked Quentin.
</p>

<p>
"This subpÅ“na, which Monkton's servant
picked up in a wine-house and brought us,"
replied Askerne, opening a letter and reading it, as
follows:
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="noindent">
  "Head-quarters, Alva-de-Tormes,<br />

<p>
"SENOR PADRE,&mdash;A general court-martial having
been appointed to be held here, for the trial
of Mr. Quentin Kennedy, serving with the 25th
Regiment, upon sundry charges exhibited against
him; and the said Mr. Kennedy having represented
that your testimony will be very material
in the investigation of some of the articles of
charge, and having requested that you may be
officially summoned as a witness, I am to desire
you, and you are hereby required, to give your
attendance here to-morrow, at ten o'clock in the
morning, at which time it is conceived your
evidence will become necessary.
</p>

<p class="noindent">
  "I have the honour to be, &amp;c., &amp;c.,<br />

</p>

<p class="noindent">
"El Senor Padre Trevino."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"This is some trickery!" exclaimed Quentin;
"Trevino is the ruffian of whom I have spoken
more than once; the man's doubly my enemy.
Well, well! save myself, it matters little to any
one what becomes of me," he added bitterly.  "I
have no kindred&mdash;not a relation that I know of
in the wide world, and save yourselves, no friends
now to regret me or to remember me, save one
of whom I cannot speak.  It is thus better as it is."
</p>

<p>
"How?" asked Askerne, who grasped him
firmly by the hand.
</p>

<p>
"For if this false accusation, whatever it is,
be proved against me, then none shall blush for
my dishonour or sorrow for my fall.  Fools may
laugh and the wicked may jeer, but the death
volley will close up my ears for ever.  It may do
more," he added, in a broken voice; "it may be
the means of revealing to me who was my
mother, who my father, with the great secret of
eternity after all; so, my dear Askerne, I am,
you see, reckless of the future."
</p>

<p>
"Damme, Quentin, this will never do&mdash;&mdash;"
Monkton was beginning, when Askerne spoke.
</p>

<p>
"In this mingled mood of sullenness and
resignation you will destroy all chance of defeating
the machinations of your enemy, for such
I&mdash;I&mdash;consider our colonel to be," said the captain
of grenadiers, after a pause.  "Buckle and I
will prepare your declaration for to-morrow, and
it shall be sent to you for revision and
emendation soon after reveille; but you must take
courage&mdash;I insist upon it, for your own sake!"
</p>

<p>
"I do not lack it!" replied Quentin, firmly.
</p>

<p>
"By courage, I do not mean an indifference
that is the result of misanthropy, or a boldness
that is gathered from despair.  At your years,
Quentin, either were unnatural," said Askerne,
kindly.
</p>

<p>
"My brave lad," said Monkton, putting an
arm round him as an elder brother might have
done, "have you really no fear of&mdash;of death?"
</p>

<p>
"To say that I have not," replied Quentin,
with quivering lip, "would be to state that which
is false; but I know death to be the ordinance of
God&mdash;the fate of all mankind.  It is but the end
of the course of time&mdash;welcome only to such as
are weary of their lives.  I am not weary of
mine, therefore I would indeed find it hard to
die.  I have always known that I must die, but
never considered where or how&mdash;how near or how
distant the day of doom might be; but I do
shrink with horror at the contemplation of dying
with a disgrace upon me&mdash;a stigma which,
though I am innocent, time may never remove."
</p>

<p>
"I fear that we are but poor comforters, and
that you are taking the very blackest view of
matters," said Askerne; "but be advised by
me, and take courage&mdash;a resolute and modest
bearing always wins respect.  In the court
to-morrow are friends who will not see you wronged,
for every member there is alike a judge and a
juryman.  Put your trust in Heaven and in your
own innocence; sleep well if you can&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"And be sure to take something by way of
breakfast&mdash;a broiled bone and a glass of
Valdepenas&mdash;you have a long and anxious day before
you."
</p>

<p>
"And so, till we meet again, good night&mdash;God
bless you, my hearty!"
</p>

<p>
They shook him warmly by the hand, and retired.
</p>

<p>
He heard their footsteps descending the stone
steps of the old tower (erst trod by the feet of
many a turbaned Moor and steel-clad crusader),
and then dying away in distance; but soothed
and relieved in mind by a visit performed at such
risk by his friends, and hoping much&mdash;he knew
not what&mdash;from the notes made by Rowland
Askerne, Quentin lay down on his pallet and strove
to sleep, amid a silence broken only by the beating
of his own heart, and the rush of the Tormes in
its deep and rocky bed.
</p>

<p>
"<i>They</i> at least believe in me, and will not
desert me!" he repeated to himself again and
again.
</p>

<p>
But, the brave boyish spirit and hope&mdash;the
enthusiastic desire to achieve something great and
good, no matter what, by land or sea, by flood or
field&mdash;a glorious deed that present men should
vaunt, and those of future times would speak
of&mdash;where were that hope and spirit <i>now</i>?

CHAPTER X.
<br /><br />
THE COURT-MARTIAL.
</h3>

<p class="intropoem">
  "Self-reverence, self-knowledge, self-control,<br />
  These three alone lead life to sovereign power.<br />
  Yet not for power, (power of herself<br />
  Would come uncall'd for,) but to live by law,<br />
  Acting the law we live by without fear;<br />
  And because right is right, to follow right<br />
  Were wisdom in the scorn of consequence."<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TENNYSON.<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The court-martial assembled in a large and
magnificent apartment of the Alva palace or castle,
which stands in the centre of the town.  It is in
a good state of preservation, and the chamber
usually occupied by the terrible duke, with all its
ancient furniture, still remains there in its original
state.
</p>

<p>
On the walls of the great apartment selected
for the court hung the armour of the successive
princes of the house of Toledo from a very remote
period&mdash;indeed, from the mail shirts that had
resisted the Moorish scimitars down to the steel caps
and jacks of the war of the Spanish succession;
and many of the breast-plates were emblazoned
with the armorial bearings and trophies of those
warlike dukes who boast of their descent from the
Paleologi Emperors of the East, and who were
first ennobled as peers of Leon by Alphonso VI.,
or the Brave, of Castile, in 1085.
</p>

<p>
As Quentin approached the great embattled
door of this stately mansion, many soldiers of the
regiment were crowding about it, and all these
muttered their good wishes; many a hard but
honest hand was held out to him, and many a
forage-cap waved in silence, evincing emotions of
good-will that stirred his heart with gratitude,
and gave him new courage as he entered the
court, attended by the provost-marshal.
</p>

<p>
He certainly looked wan and ill; traces yet
remained of his recent illness at the Villa de
Maciera; to these were added anxiety, lack of
proper food and sleep, with the toil and exposure
incident to the campaign, all of which served to give
him interest in the eyes of many, for the court
was crowded by spectators, chiefly officers of
nearly every regiment in the division, and a few
Spanish citizens and priests of Alva.
</p>

<p>
His young face appeared sorrow-struck in
feature, and many read there, in the thoughtful
brow, the quivering lip, and the sad but restless
eye, indications of a proud but suffering spirit.
Save these, and an occasional unconscious twitching
of the hands, Quentin, though awed by the
presence, and the hapless and novel predicament
in which he found himself, was calm and collected
in appearance.
</p>

<p>
He was simply clad in his unlaced and plain
red coat, without a belt or accoutrement of any
kind, to indicate that he was a prisoner; and he
was accommodated with a chair and separate table,
on which lay writing materials, but these he had
not the slightest intention of using.
</p>

<p>
At the head of a long table of formidable
aspect, whereon lay a Bible and the "Articles of
War," and which was littered with pens, paper,
letters, &amp;c., sat the president of the court,
Colonel Colquhoun Grant, in the gorgeous uniform
of the 15th Hussars, blue faced with red, and
the breast a mass of silver embroidery that
might have turned a sword-cut.  He wore the
Order of Merit, given to every officer of his
regiment by the Emperor of Germany fourteen
years before, for their unexampled bravery in the
affair of Villiers en Couche, a name still borne
on the standard of the Hussars.
</p>

<p>
The other members, fourteen in number, belonged
to different regiments; but Quentin was
truly glad to see among them the familiar faces
of Askerne and two other captains of the
Borderers.  All were in full uniform, and were seated
on the right and left of the president, according
to their seniority in the army; Captain Conyers,
acting as judge-advocate, being placed at the foot
of the court, which, by the showy uniform, large
epaulettes of silver or gold, the crimson sashes,
and, in four instances, tartan plaids, of the
members, had a very rich and striking appearance as
the morning sunshine streamed along the stately
room through six lofty and latticed windows.
</p>

<p>
A considerable bustle and treading of feet on
the tessellated floor announced the entrance of the
various witnesses, among whom Quentin recognised
the tall figure of the Master of Rohallion,
the sturdy paunch of worthy Major Middleton,
the sun-burned faces of Buckle and others of the
Borderers, together with a Dominican monk, in
whom, notwithstanding his freshly-shaven chin,
long robe, and knotted girdle, he recognised, with
astonishment, Trevino!  Other guerillas were
present, but the most prominent was Don Baltasar.
</p>

<p>
The handsome but sallow visage of the latter
was pale nearly as that of a corpse; his
bloodless lips and white glistening teeth appeared
ghastly beneath the coal-black and enormous
moustaches that were twisted savagely up to
each ear.  His nostrils were contracting and
dilating with wild, mad passion, and it was
evident that nothing but the presence he stood in
prevented him from rushing, sword in hand, on
Quentin, and ending, there and then, the
proceedings of the court and our story by immolating
him on the spot.
</p>

<p>
Quite undeterred by his formidable aspect or
excitement, some of the younger officers were
seen to quiz Baltasar, whose costume, an
embroidered black velvet jacket, with a pair of
British flank-company wings, and other accessories,
was sufficiently mock-heroic, fanciful, and
absurd.
</p>

<p>
"Who acts as the prisoner's counsel or
friend?" asked Colonel Grant, the president.
</p>

<p>
"I&mdash;Captain Warriston, 94th&mdash;Scots Brigade,"
said the full mellow voice of that officer, as he
entered, fully accoutred with sword, sash, and
gorget, and took his seat at the little table beside
Quentin Kennedy, who, at the moment, felt his
heart very full indeed.
</p>

<p>
Captain Conyers now read the order for
assembling the court, and then the members, each
with his ungloved right hand placed upon the
open Bible, were sworn the usual oath, "to
administer justice according to the rules and articles
for the better government of his Majesty's forces,
&amp;c., without partiality, favour, or affection, &amp;c.;
and further, not to divulge the sentence of the
court until approved of, or the vote or opinion of
any member thereof, unless required to do so by
a court of law."
</p>

<p>
This formula over, the judge advocate desired
Quentin to stand while the charges against him
were read; and to his utter bewilderment they
ran thus, briefly, as we omit many dates and
repetitions:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Quentin Kennedy, volunteer, serving
with his Majesty's 25th Foot, accused in the
following instances of conduct unbecoming a
gentleman and soldier:
</p>

<p>
"<i>First;</i> of rescuing by the strong hand a
French officer and lawful prisoner of war from Don
Baltasar de Saldos, in direct violation of the 51st
clause of the 2nd section of the 'Articles of War.'
</p>

<p>
"<i>Second;</i> of giving the rescued prisoner such
intelligence as enabled the enemy, then cantoned
in Valencia de Alcantara, to anticipate, by a
combined attack, the junction about to be formed
by the guerilla force of Don Baltasar with the
division of the allied army under Lieutenant-General
Sir John Hope, and thus causing the
loss of five field-guns and many Spanish subjects.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Third;</i> of snaring away from the cantonment
at Herreruela the sister of Don Baltasar de
Saldos, who has not since been heard of, her fate
being thus involved in mystery, or worse, and
thereby the prisoner contravened the order issued
by Sir John Moore, urging the conciliation of
the Spanish people on the army entering Castile.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Fourth;</i> of assaulting in the town of Merida,
to the effusion of blood, the Reverend Padre
Trevino, lately a Dominican monk of Salamanca,
and now chaplain to Don Baltasar de Saldos, in
direct contravention of the 37th clause of the 2nd
section of the 'Articles of War,' concerning any
officer or soldier 'who shall offer violence to a
chaplain of the army or to <i>any other minister of
God's word</i>.'
</p>

<p>
"<i>Fifth;</i> of plundering an inhabitant to the
extent of at least eighty gold moidores, part of
which were found in his baggage and part given
to the paymaster of his Majesty's 25th Foot for
transmission home.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Sixth;</i> for refusing or declining to take
another despatch to Don Baltasar, from Montijo,
and thereby showing a complicity with the enemy
and dread of detection by the loyal party in
Spain."
</p>

<p>
So ended this farrago of words.
</p>

<p>
Aware that sooner or later the proceedings of
the court-martial (which we can assure the reader
made some noise at the time) would be read at
Rohallion, Colonel Crawford had all the charges
framed in the name of the general of division.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Cosmo!" thought Quentin, "you aim
not only at my life, but at my honour!"
</p>

<p>
"Well, 'pon my soul," thought the Master,
after he heard the list of charges read, "if the
fellow gets over all these, I'll say that, with a
fair match, and equally weighted, he might run a
race with the devil himself!"
</p>

<p>
Quentin pleaded <i>not guilty</i>.
</p>

<p>
The court was then cleared of the witnesses
and the proceedings commenced.
</p>

<p>
With the regular detail of these we have no
intention of afflicting the reader; suffice it, that
the solemn and dreary writing down of every
question and answer so lengthened them out
that they became a source of irritation and agony
to one whose temperament was so sharp and
impetuous as that of Quentin Kennedy, burning as
he was with indignation at accusations so false
and so unmerited, and some of which he had a
difficulty in refuting; and, we regret to add, that
the form of procedure was then, as it is still,
old-fashioned, cumbrous, loose, and tedious.
</p>

<p>
There was no regular legal counsel for the
prisoner or for the prosecution either; no
cross-examination, save such as might emanate from
some unusually sharp fellow, who kept himself
awake, and affected to take notes, when in reality
he was caricaturing Middleton's pigtail, Smith's
paunch, and Brown's nose.
</p>

<p>
The witnesses were sometimes examined pell-mell,
just as their names stood on the list; their
evidence, however, being carefully written down,
to the end that it might be read over to them
for after-thought or revision before the opinions
of the court, as to guilt and sentence, were asked;
a formula that always begins with the junior
member, the president having the casting vote.
</p>

<p>
Such was then, as it is now, the somewhat
rambling, free and easy tenor of a general court-martial;
yet, with all its idiosyncrasies, it is ever
a just and honourable tribunal, and such as no
true soldier would ever wish to change for a civil
one.  Every member sworn is bound to give an
opinion.  In the French service a military offence
can be tried after the lapse of ten years; with
us, the period is three.
</p>

<p>
Warriston objected to the competency of the
court; but the president over-ruled his objection
by stating that a Volunteer of the Line, like
every other camp-follower, was amenable to the
"Articles of War."
</p>

<p>
The transmission of the despatch to Don
Baltasar was easily proved by Cosmo and others,
and by the reply, which lay on the table.
</p>

<p>
Though handsome and soldierly in aspect and
bearing, the Master of Rohallion could scarcely
conceal a very decided animus in delivering his
evidence.  Brave and proud, he was yet weak
enough and small enough in mind to <i>hate</i> Quentin
Kennedy with that species of animosity which
is always the most bitter, because it arises from
a sense of unmerited wrong done to the weaker
victim.
</p>

<p>
In answer to a question by the president:
</p>

<p>
"Of the prisoner's antecedents," said he, "I
know very little&mdash;little at least that is good or
honourable."
</p>

<p>
"Colonel Crawford, you will be so good as
explain."
</p>

<p>
"He was received as an orphan, an outcast,
I believe, into the house of my father, General
Lord Rohallion, when I was serving with the
Brigade of Guards.  That house he deserted
ungratefully and disappeared for a time, no trace
of him being discovered but a silver-mounted
walking-stick, which I knew to be his, and which
was found beside a murdered man, a vagrant or
gipsy, in the vault of an old ruin called Kilhenzie.
How it came there, I pretend not to say; but
on searching the vault, whither my pointers led
me, I picked up the stick, with marks of blood
upon it, some days after the body had been
taken away."
</p>

<p>
On hearing this cruel and artful speech, which
contained so much of reality, Quentin almost
started from his chair, his eyes flashing and his
pale nether lip quivering with rage; but Warriston
held him forcibly back.
</p>

<p>
"Prisoner," said the president, "do you know
a place in Scotland called the castle of Kilhenzie?"
</p>

<p>
"I do not understand the meaning of this
question," said Captain Warriston, rising
impetuously, "and to it I object!  It is not
precise on the part of the prosecution, and discloses
an intention of following up a line of examination
of which neither the prisoner nor his <i>amici curiÃ¦</i>
have received due notice, and which, moreover,
is not stated in the six charges before the court."
</p>

<p>
After a consultation, Colonel Grant replied:
</p>

<p>
"The line of examination in this instance,
Captain Warriston, is to prove previous character;
thus we find it quite relevant to question the
prisoner concerning the episode referred to.  It
may bear very materially on other matters before
the court.  Mr. Kennedy, do you know a place
called Kilhenzie?"
</p>

<p>
"I do, sir," said Quentin, and for a moment
there rushed upon his memory recollections of
many a happy hour spent there with Flora
Warrender, near its crumbling walls and giant
dule-tree.
</p>

<p>
"Are you aware of any remarkable circumstance
occurring there in which you were an
actor?"
</p>

<p>
Poor Quentin's pallor now gave way to a flush
of shame and honest anger; but he replied&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Driven into the ruin by a torrent of rain,
I found a dead body lying there among the straw;
it filled me with alarm and dismay, so I hastened
from the place."
</p>

<p>
"Leaving behind you a walking-stick?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir; it would appear so."
</p>

<p>
"Covered with blood."
</p>

<p>
"Most likely," said Quentin, remembering the
wound he had received from Cosmo's hand.
</p>

<p>
"All this, Colonel Grant, has nothing to do
with the case," urged Warriston, firmly.
</p>

<p>
"It seems to cast grave doubts on the previous
character and antecedents of the prisoner."
</p>

<p>
"It seems also to show the peculiar vindictiveness
of the prosecution."
</p>

<p>
"You are unwise, Captain Warriston," said the
president, severely.
</p>

<p>
"I am here as the friend of the prisoner."
</p>

<p>
"For what reason did you leave the castle of
Rohallion?" asked the court.
</p>

<p>
Quentin gazed full at the Master with his eyes
flashing so dangerously that this personage, fearing
he might be driven to say something which might
bring ridicule on him&mdash;though Quentin would
rather have died than uttered Flora's name
there&mdash;begged that the first charge might be
proceeded with.
</p>

<p>
Sworn across two drawn swords in the Spanish
fashion, Baltasar, Trevino, and other guerillas,
inspired by spite and hostility, related in
succession how Quentin had rescued the French
prisoner; how he had undertaken to conduct Donna
Isidora in safety to Portalegre, a mere day's ride;
but had made away with her, on the road, in some
manner unknown, as well as with a horse and
mule, the property of her brother.
</p>

<p>
"A singular duenna to have charge of a
young Spanish beauty&mdash;eh, Carysfort?" he heard
a hussar say.
</p>

<p>
"By Jove, Villars, I wish it had been my
luck&mdash;that's all," was the laughing reply.
</p>

<p>
Quentin wished the same with all his heart.
</p>

<p>
Then came details of the attack made on the
guerillas by Ribeaupierre's cavalry brigade.  The
charge of giving intelligence to the enemy was
based on bare assumption, and was unsupported
by a tittle of evidence.
</p>

<p>
Next followed the Padre Trevino, costumed for
the occasion and effect, a rare example of a wolf
in sheep's clothing, who showed his wounded
caput, and told, in a whining voice, the sorrowful
story of his maltreatment at the aqueduct of
Merida, whither he had gone to pray in solitude.
The assault was proved beyond a doubt by the
evidence of a certain Martin Sedillo, an ill-looking
dog with one eye, formerly an alguazil of Salamanca
and now a guerilla, who swore distinctly
that he saw Quentin beat the padre down with
the butt-end of his musket.
</p>

<p>
"You distinctly saw him strike the padre
down?" repeated Colonel Grant.
</p>

<p>
"Si, senor presidente y senores oficiales," said
the guerilla, bowing low.
</p>

<p>
"Wantonly?"
</p>

<p>
"Most wantonly, senores."
</p>

<p>
"Retire.  Call the next witness on the
list&mdash;private Allan Grange, 25th Foot."
</p>

<p>
To the Borderer, on his entrance, the previous
questions were repeated by the court.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir&mdash;I saw Mr. Kennedy strike down
the guerilla (who was not then habited like a
friar) with his clubbed musket, but only in time
to save his life from <i>this dagger</i>, which I took
from the hand of his reverence."
</p>

<p>
As he spoke, Allan Grange handed a knife of
very ugly aspect to the president, who saw the
name <i>Trevino</i> burned, by a hot iron, on the haft.
</p>

<p>
"Allan Grange, were you ever tried by a
court-martial?" asked the judge advocate, looking
among his memoranda for one furnished by Colonel
Crawford.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir," faltered the soldier, growing red
and pale by turns.
</p>

<p>
"And were reduced to the ranks, at Colchester?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir," he replied, sadly.
</p>

<p>
"And you were sentenced to be flogged&mdash;three
hundred lashes, I think, by the Defaulter's Book?"
</p>

<p>
"A sentence kindly remitted by Major
Middleton," said Grange, proudly.
</p>

<p>
"There, this will do&mdash;you may go," said
Colonel Grant; and then some of the members
smiled and looked at each other, as much as to
say, "we see how much your evidence is worth."
</p>

<p>
Quentin knew that Donna Isidora was in the
French camp; but when Warriston mentioned this
to be the case, the only witness called to prove it,
Lieutenant Monkton, was unable to repeat what
Ribeaupierre said, as he had been beyond
hearing at that particular moment.
</p>

<p>
On the fifth charge, concerning the gold
moidores, Quentin thought himself bewitched when
the one-eyed guerilla, Martin Sedillo, deliberately
swore, with the drawn swords of two officers
crossed under his bearded chin, "that he was
plundered of them at Herreruela by the prisoner,
whom he was ready to warrant as false as
Galalou!"
</p>

<p>
"Who was he?" inquired Askerne, looking
at his watch impatiently for the third time.
</p>

<p>
"Galalou betrayed the French army at Roncesvalles,"
said Colonel Grant; "as we say in Scotland,
false as Menteith.  It is a local phrase."
</p>

<p>
His refusal to bear another despatch to De
Saldos was easily proved, and that circumstance
seemed to corroborate much that had preceded it.
</p>

<p>
Matters were now looking gloomy indeed.
Quentin became sick at heart; he drained his
water-jug, yet his lips grew parched and dry; he
felt the toils closing around him, and already, in
fancy, he heard the president passing the terrible
sentence of death!
</p>

<p>
The bitter conviction came home to his soul,
that hate and wiles, against which it was in vain
for innocence to contend, were triumphing over
him; and that even if pardoned, the memory that
he had been arraigned, and on such cruel charges,
would live!
</p>

<p>
Shame for unmerited reproach and unavailing
sorrow for a lost youth&mdash;a blighted, it might be,
a long life taken away, and perhaps by a shameful
death&mdash;were some of the deep, the bitter, and
stinging emotions felt on this day by poor
Quentin Kennedy.
</p>

<p>
While that court-martial lasted he lived a
lifetime in every hour of it!
</p>

<p>
His declaration or defence, read by Warriston,
was simply a recapitulation of some of the leading
features of our narrative, which he had no means
of substantiating; the mass of evidence against
him was summed up, but was too strong in some
points to be easily disposed of.  His youth and
inexperience were dwelt upon, but it seemed
without much avail.  Neither did the warm
manner in which Major Middleton, Buckle,
Sergeant-major Calder and others, bore testimony to
his spotless character, seem to find much weight.
To satisfy the Spaniards, a victim was wanted,
and here was one ready made to hand.
</p>

<p>
It was now nearly four o'clock, and the Court
was about to be cleared for the consideration of
the opinion and sentence, when the sharp and
well-known twang of a French cavalry trumpet
rang in the court before the palace, and the
tramping of horses was heard.
</p>

<p>
"Thank God!" muttered Askerne (who had
frequently consulted his watch) as he exchanged
a rapid glance with Monkton; "that muleteer
has served us well!"
</p>

<p>
At that moment of terrible expectation an
officer of the 7th Hussars entered hastily, and
presented a note to the judge advocate.
</p>

<p>
"What interruption is this, Captain Conyers?"
asked Colonel Grant, sternly.
</p>

<p>
"An officer from the French lines, come in
under a flag of truce, requests to be examined by
the Court for the defence," replied Conyers.
</p>

<p>
Every face present expressed extreme astonishment.
</p>

<p>
"What is his name?" asked the president.
</p>

<p>
"Eugene de Ribeaupierre&mdash;sous-lieutenant of
the 24th Chasseurs Ã  Cheval," said Conyers,
consulting an embossed calling-card.
</p>

<p>
"Is it he whose name occurs so frequently in
the declaration of the prisoner?"
</p>

<p>
"Most probably, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Admit him."
</p>

<p>
The clank of a sabre and the jingle of steel
spurs were heard, and then Eugene de Ribeaupierre,
looking handsome and gay, but flushed
after a long ride from Fonteveros, entered, helmet
in hand, and bowed low to the Court and all who
were present.
</p>

<p>
"Ha, mon ami!" said he, shaking Quentin's
hand with warmth, "I am come in time, I hope;
the proceedings are not yet closed, monsieur?" he
asked anxiously of the president.
</p>

<p>
"No&mdash;but how did <i>you</i> come to hear of them?"
was the suspicious question.
</p>

<p>
"From Ramon Campillo, a muleteer of Miranda
del Ebro; the same person who conveyed M. Kennedy
from the Villa de Maciera to Portalegre, and
who was passing through our camp this morning.
He came expressly to my tent to tell me all about
it, and that charges were to be made which I
alone could refute.  I reported the affair to my
father, the General, who generously gave me
leave to come here, with an escort&mdash;so I have
come, messieurs, to be sworn and examined."
</p>

<p>
"Askerne," whispered Monkton, "you are a
rare fellow!"
</p>

<p>
"How, Willie?"
</p>

<p>
"Damme, by your foresight we shall
yet baffle Crawford, De Saldos, Trevino and Co.!"
</p>

<p>
"Hush, hush!  You are rash."
</p>

<p>
It is almost needless to describe how the young
French officer, after being duly sworn by the
judge advocate, corroborated in every particular
the statement made in Quentin's declaration&mdash;statements
of which he could have had no previous
cognisance, save as an actor in the episodes
referred to.  He described how Quentin had saved
his life from a deliberate attempt at assassination
on the part of De Saldos, and became strongly
excited on referring to the infamous massacre of
the prisoners by Trevino.  He asserted that the
moidores were taken by himself from the holsters
of Raoul, a dead corporal of his troop, who found
them amid the plunder of Coimbra.  He asserted,
on his oath and honour as an officer and chevalier
of the Legion of Honour, that the movement
made by the troops of his father, collaterally with
those of General Hope and the guerillas of
Baltasar, was not consequent to any information
given him by the prisoner, but had been resolved
on long before, as a printed order of the emperor,
which he had the honour to lay on the table, would
amply testify!
</p>

<p>
As for Donna Isidora, he freely and laughingly
acknowledged that he had carried her away from
the villa, and that she was now Madame de MarbÅ“uf,
wife of his friend Jules de MarbÅ“uf, colonel
of the 24th, as the Padre Florez, who, ignorant
of that auspicious event, had come to effect her
release from the French camp, could now
substantiate, as he was now without the court, and
ready to appear.
</p>

<p>
The long, thin figure of the padre, wearing his
flowing soutan and shovel hat, next appeared to
corroborate all this, and also to state the sickly
condition in which he handed over Quentin to
the muleteers at the Villa de Maciera.
</p>

<p>
"Every link is thus supplied beyond a doubt!"
exclaimed Colonel Grant.
</p>

<p>
Quentin was acquitted amid a burst of applause
that found an echo in the hearty hurrah
given by the King's Own Borderers in the palace
square without.
</p>

<p>
"And now, monsieur," said Ribeaupierre,
presenting Quentin with a valuable diamond ring,
"accept this as a present from madame my
mother, who drew it from her finger as I left the
camp, with the request that you will wear it for
her sake, and in memory of the day on which you
saved my life from that barbarous Spaniard among
the mountains of Herreruela."
</p>

<p>
Within an hour after rendering service so
valuable, and indeed so priceless, and after having
some luncheon with Askerne, Grant, Conyers,
and other officers who composed the court, the
gallant and generous Ribeaupierre had mounted
and ridden from Alva de Tormes, attended by a
strong escort, in front of which rode a Polish
lancer, with a white handkerchief in token of
truce streaming from the head of his lance; and
so ended&mdash;like a dream to Quentin&mdash;this episode,
this chivalric intervention, which was dictated by
a noble spirit worthy of the knightly days of the
Chevalier Bayard, or of Bertrand du Guesclin.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XI.
<br /><br />
LOVE ME.
</h3>

<p class="intropoem">
  "You do return me back on memory's path<br />
  To dear remembered scenes.  Old Scotland's scenes!<br />
  It is a glorious land!  I long to roam,<br />
  Doubly a lover, 'mong its wildest charms;<br />
  Its glens, its rocky coast, its towering cliffs<br />
  Come o'er me like a dream of infancy,<br />
  Startling the soul to momentary rapture;<br />
  It is the voice of home!"&mdash;DANIEL.<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Two or three days passed before Quentin quite
recovered his equanimity, or felt assured of his
safety, and then as the whole affair of the
court-martial seemed like a night-mare, he might have
deemed it all a dream, but for the occasional
comments and congratulations of his friends, and
for the splendid gift of Madame de Ribeaupierre,
which he prized greatly for its whole history,
and which he longed greatly to place on one of
Flora Warrender's tiny fingers.
</p>

<p>
Three days after the sitting of the court,
tidings came to Alva that Baltasar de Saldos and
his guerilla force had suffered a sharp repulse
with great loss by the French, whose post at
Fonteveras they had attacked with unexampled
fury and blind rashness&mdash;both perhaps inspired
by Donna Isidora's defection from her country's
cause&mdash;and that in the confused retreat upon
Hope's picquets, the luckless Baltasar had been
shot dead by one of the Westphalian Light Horse.
</p>

<p>
We are not ashamed to say that Quentin on
hearing this from Major Middleton, felt a species
of relief, self-preservation being one of the first
laws of nature, and he never could have felt
himself perfectly safe in Spain while Baltasar de
Saldos trod its soil.
</p>

<p>
Reflection on all the past served but to
embitter the disgust and wrath with which he viewed
the bearing of Cosmo Crawford at the recent
trial, his whole connexion with it, and the terrible
and hopeless malevolence he exhibited in reference
to the episode at Kilhenzie, an affair which there
was some difficulty in explaining, without referring
to other and irrelevant matters; so Quentin burned
with impatient eagerness for a general engagement
with the French, for anything that would
serve to blot out the recollection of his late
unmerited humiliation; but he never thought of the
enemy now without the face, figure, and voice of
his friend Ribeaupierre rising upbraidingly before
him.
</p>

<p>
Cosmo could have dismissed Quentin from the
regiment, with or without cause, a colonel being
himself sole judge of the expediency of so getting
rid of a volunteer; but he was ashamed that his
own family should hear of an act so petty.  The
onus of the futile court-martial fell on the general
of division, and there were many chances against
Quentin ever relating its secret history at Rohallion,
as ere long bullets would be flying thick as
winter hail.
</p>

<p>
Amid that confidence which is inspired by a
borrachio-skin of good Valdepenas, varied by stiff
brandy-and-water, Quentin, so far as he deemed
necessary or right, made "a clean breast of it"
to his friends and comrades, and detailed anew
his adventures on the road from Herreruela and
at the Villa de Maciera.  Though he was
complimented by Warriston and Askerne, whose praise
was of value, there were not a few, such as
Monkton, Colville, Ensigns Colyear, Boyle and others,
who laughed immoderately, and voted him "a
downright spoon"&mdash;wishing "such jolly good-luck
had been theirs as to have a dazzling Castilian
chucking herself at their heads."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, damme," said Monkton, "I should have
had another story to tell; though, certainly,
Kennedy, your Dulcinea did not 'let concealment
like a worm i' the bud'&mdash;how does the quotation
end?  Now, Pimple, are you going to keep that
blessed borrachio-skin all night?  Why, man,
you have squeezed it till it has become like a
half-empty bagpipe."
</p>

<p>
Elsewhere we have mentioned that, after reading
the famous newspaper paragraph which made
such a commotion among the secluded household
at Rohallion, the quartermaster offered to write
to Quentin, and that Flora gave him a tiny note
to enclose in his letter.
</p>

<p>
So it was on this night, when returning from
Monkton's billet to his own, with a head none of
the clearest, after talking a vast deal, smoking
cigars and drinking the country wine, that
Quentin was startled&mdash;completely sobered, in
fact&mdash;by his servant placing in his hand a letter, and
saying briefly that "the mail had come up that
evening from the rear," which meant from Lisbon.
</p>

<p>
This letter was covered by such a multitude of
post-marks that some time elapsed before
Quentin&mdash;all unused to receive such documents&mdash;could
bring himself to examine the contents; nor, in
his mute astonishment, did he do so, until he
had fully deciphered the address, which was in
old John Girvan's hand, and the seal, an
antiquated button of the 25th Foot, with the number,
of course, reversed.
</p>

<p>
Every word seemed like <i>a voice from home</i>,
and all the past&mdash;faces, forms, scenes, and places,
came like a living and moving panorama on his
memory.
</p>

<p>
Then, almost giddy with delight, a heart tremulous
with anxiety, and eyes that grew moist&mdash;so
moist, indeed, that for some seconds he could see
no more than that the letter was dated more than
a month back, Quentin was striving to read the
square, old-fashioned writing of his early friend,
when something dropped from between the pages&mdash;a
tiny note, sealed by blue wax&mdash;the crest a
hare <i>sejant</i>, the cognisance of the Warrenders.
</p>

<p>
Excited anew, he opened this with extreme
care but tremulous haste.  It was a single sheet
of note-paper, on which two words were written,
in a hand he knew right well&mdash;<i>From Flora</i>&mdash;and
in it was a valuable ring, studded with precious
stones.
</p>

<p>
We are compelled to admit that Quentin kissed
the words and the ring some dozen times or so
before he put the paper containing the former
next his heart, in the most approved manner of
all lovers, and the circlet on his finger, where he
continued to admire it from time to time, while
deciphering the long and somewhat prosy, but
kind letter of his worthy old friend, who evidently
knew nothing about the unlucky court-martial
being on the tapis when he wrote it, Lord Rohallion's
startling reply from the Horse Guards not
having then arrived.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"MY DEAR QUENTIN,&mdash;And so by God's providence,
through the humble medium of a stray
newspaper, we have found you at last!  Ye rash
and ungrateful callant to leave us all in such a
fashion, and well-nigh unto demented lest you
had come to skaith or evil.  I'll never forget the
night the news first came to Rohallion that you
had been found.  You mind o' my auld Flanders
greybeard&mdash;the Roman amphora, as the dominie
calls it&mdash;he and I, wi' Spillsby and auld Jack
Andrews, emptied it to the last drop, drinking
your health, pouring forth libations in your
honour, as Symon Skail hath it, and singing
'Should auld acquaintance be forgot' as we have
never sung it since Robbie Burns left Mossgiel.
</p>

<p>
"And so, Quentin, my lad, ye have gone forth
even as I went, nigh half a century ago, and have
joined the glorious old 25th too!  The Lord's
blessing be on the old number, wherever it
be&mdash;even on the head of a beer barrel!  I joined the
Borderers with little more than my father's
benediction on my head, and, what served me better,
one of my mother's pease-bannocks in my pouch.
After Minden I came home a corporal, and proud
I am to say, that I was the poor wayworn soldier-lad
whom Burns saw passing the inn at Brownhill,
and whom he invited to share his supper on
the night he wrote his song&mdash;

(and a gude deal in pipeclay), I became, as I am

"As for Cosmo the Master, I fear me you'll
find him a harsh and severe colonel.  He was aye
a dour laddie, and a heartbreak to his mother.
</p>

<p>
"The Lord and the Lady Rohallion, and a'
body here, down to the running footman, send you
their best remembrances.  Miss Flora, of Ardgour,
writes for herself, and what her note contains is
no business of <i>mine</i>.  Yesterday I caught her
looking at the map of Spain in the library, and
then she turned to that of Europe.
</p>

<p>
"'Girvanmains, it seems only the length of a
finger from here to Spain,' said she, placing a
bonnie white hand on the map, 'and yet it is so
far&mdash;so <i>very</i> far away!'
</p>

<p>
"She often comes into my snuggery and speaks
of you, the puir lassie, with her eyes and heart
full.  She has taken your terrier as her peculiar
care, and sees that the gamekeeper has your guns
and fishing-tackle always in order, for she looks
forward, doubtless, to a time when you will need
them all again.
</p>

<p>
"She is as handsome and high-spirited as ever!
Young Ferny of Fernwoodlee, dangles pretty
closely about her now, and village gossips say they
may make a good match, as his lands march with
the haughs of Ardgour.  If they do, I am sure
you won't care much about it now, for active
service rubs all soft nonsense out of a young
fellow's head, just as his waistbelt rubs his coat
bare.  (How little the worthy quartermaster, as
he blundered on, conceived that he was now
sticking pins and needles into poor Quentin by
this incidental communication about the young
fox-hunting laird of Fernwoodlee!)
</p>

<p>
"A long war is before us, Quentin, lad, and
you're certain to rise in the service and be spoken
about in future times, as Wolfe and Abercrombie
are now.  Maybe I'll not live to see the day&mdash;at
my years it is not likely, but I know that it <i>will</i>
happen for all that, when the grass is growing
green above me in the auld kirkyard up the glen.
</p>

<p>
"The dominie&mdash;he is sitting opposite me
brewing his toddy at this moment&mdash;hopes that
you have not fallen into the vile habit of uttering
oaths&mdash;a habit peculiar to gentlemen of our army
ever since it 'swore so terribly in Flanders.'  He
bids me say that 'from a common custom of
swearing, according to Hierocles (some Roman
loon, I warrant) men easily slide into falsity;
therefore do not use to swear.'  He also hopes
that you are not becoming contaminated in those
realms of the Pope, who, though he founded all
the bishoprics and most of the universities of
Christendom, enjoyeth the evil repute of being
little better than a Pagan and idolater among us
here in Carrick.  Moreover, ye are in an especial
manner to avoid the snares of the female sex, and
remember the mischief that was wrought by a
light limmer named Helen of Troy.
</p>

<p>
"From myself, dear Quentin, I say avoid all
duellists, drunkards, gamblers, and fools; as a
good old friend of mine&mdash;a brave soldier, too&mdash;saith
in his book, 'Provide for your soul, and God
will provide for your honour.  If your name be
forgot in the annals of time, it will make a noble
figure in the muster-roll of eternity.'
</p>

<p>
"If you are short of the needful, I have still
a few more golden shot in the locker, so fail not
to draw on me through Greenwood and Cox, or
your paymaster.
</p>

<p>
"I would give much, if I had it, to have one
glimpse of the old corps again, though no one in
it, I suppose, remembers old John Girvan now!
</p>

<p>
"Are the bringers-up still dressed from the
right flank by a flam on the drum?  Does the
colonel still use a speaking-trumpet?  Is the
point of war beaten now in honour of every
new commission?  Are the sergeants' pikes still
stretchers for the wounded?  Are pigtails always
dressed straight by the back seam of the coat,
and&mdash;but Lord!  Lord! what am I asking?  I
clean forgot that the service is going to the devil,
for the order that abolished the queues will be
the ruin of it, from the Horse Guards to the
Hottentot battalions!  I can't fancy the 25th,
like the Manx cats, with their tails cut off!  In
my time there would have been open mutiny if
the atrocity had been attempted.
</p>

<p>
"Even the hair-powder is passing out of fashion
now, unless a colonel happens to be powdered by
time.  Gentlemanly spirit will pass away too, I fear
me, and the cautious time will come when a man
will think twice before accepting an invitation to
go out with a brother officer and breathe the
morning air, about reveillez, at ten paces, with a
pair of saw-handled pops.
</p>

<p>
"In Rohallion's time the 25th used to wear
their hair and pigtails so floured and pomatumed
that many a good meal the barrack rats have
made off our caputs, when we lay asleep on the
wood benches of the guard-house.
</p>

<p>
"And they (the Horse Guards, we presume)
have substituted cloth pantaloons for the
pipe-clayed breeches in which we fought at Minden
and New York.  This <i>may</i> be an improvement,
for, in my time, our pipeclayed smalls were often
a mass of mud on the march, and in wet weather
one might as well have been in a bog of quick
lime, for they regularly skinned us.
</p>

<p>
"And now, Quentin, my dear, dear laddie, to
close an ower lang letter."
</p>

<p>
To Askerne, who came in at that moment,
Quentin showed the letter of the worthy veteran,
and it proved to the captain a source of some
amusement, so quaint and old-fashioned were
Girvan's ideas of the regiment and of the service.
</p>

<p>
"Well, Kennedy, what does Miss Flora's letter
contain&mdash;eh?" asked Askerne, with a waggish
smile.
</p>

<p>
"Don't jest, pray&mdash;I depend on your honour."
</p>

<p>
"You may, indeed, Quentin."
</p>

<p>
"It contained only this ring."
</p>

<p>
"Oho!" exclaimed Askerne, with a merry
laugh, "these stones tell a story, my friend."
</p>

<p>
"A story!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"How?"
</p>

<p>
"Is it possible that you don't know?  Read
their names; collect the initial letters, and tell
me what they make?"
</p>

<p>
"Lapis-lazuli, opal, verde-antique, emerald,
malachite, emerald."
</p>

<p>
"Well&mdash;what are these?"
</p>

<p>
"LOVE ME!" said Quentin, colouring with
pleasure and surprise.
</p>

<p>
"The language of the stones seems new to
you, Kennedy; but you are in luck, my friend.
Who is the donor?"
</p>

<p>
"A dear, dear friend."
</p>

<p>
"Flora, you say&mdash;are you sure it is not Donna
Isidora?"
</p>

<p>
"Impossible&mdash;thank Heaven!&mdash;a Miss Flora
Warrender."
</p>

<p>
"Warrender&mdash;Warrender&mdash;I know that name;
is she of Ardgour?"
</p>

<p>
"The same."
</p>

<p>
"Her father fell at the head of the Corsican
Rangers, in Egypt.  I knew him well&mdash;a brave
old fellow as ever wore a red coat."
</p>

<p>
"You will not speak of this before our fellows?"
urged Quentin, earnestly.
</p>

<p>
"Betray confidence! you have my word, Kennedy.
And now let me to bed.  I am for the
baggage-guard; as we are falling back, it starts with
the artillery, two hours before the division marches
to-morrow."
</p>

<p>
The ring had now a new interest in Quentin's
eyes, and he was never tired of reading the six
mystical stones.
</p>

<p>
"Dearest Flora," he said to himself, "how
happy I am now, that not even that lovely Spaniard
could for a moment tempt me to forget you!"
</p>

<p>
For all that, the "lovely Spaniard" was very
nearly doing a vast deal of mischief.
</p>

<p>
Finding that he was alone, and all was quiet
in his billet, he sat far into the hours of the silent
night, writing a long, long letter to his friend the
quartermaster&mdash;the story of his past adventures;
and to Flora he enclosed the only gift he
possessed&mdash;the ring of Madame de Ribeaupierre&mdash;with
its remarkable story, and he had barely sealed
the envelope when he heard the warning bugle for
the baggage-guard to turn out sounding in the
dark and silent streets of Alva; and then, with
a weary head but happy heart, he sought his
pallet, and without undressing, courted sleep for
a couple of hours, before the drums of the division
beat the <i>gÃ©nÃ©rale</i>.

CHAPTER XII.
<br /><br />
THE OLD BRIGADIER.

<p class="intropoem">
  "I cannot deem why men so toil for fame,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A porter is a porter, though his load<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be the oceaned world, and although his road<br />

  Sea-like we moan for ever."&mdash;ALEXANDER SMITH.<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
By this time the snows of a bleak and early
winter lay deep in the grassy glens and on the
heathery hills of Carrick; the mountain burns
and rivulets that whilome flowed to the Doon and
the Girvan were frozen hard and fast, and,
suspended in mid-air, the cascade of the Lollards'
Linn hung under its gothic arch like the beard
of Father Christmas.  Long icicles hung from
the eaves of the houses and from the quaint stone
gurgoyles of the old square keep.
</p>

<p>
The sound of the woodman's axe echoed in the
leafless oakwood shaw and the brown thickets of
Ardgour, and everywhere the hedges and trees
were being lopped and trimmed by the shears or
bill-hook of the gardener and husbandman.
</p>

<p>
In the clear frosty air, from many a mountain
loch rang up the cheers of the jovial curlers,
with the roar of the granite curling-stones as
they swept along the glassy <i>rinks</i>, and many a
hearty fellow anticipated, his appetite sharpened by
the frosty air, the banquet of salt beef and greens,
with steaming whisky toddy, that closed his day's
sport, at the Rohallion Arms in Maybole.
</p>

<p>
The cattle were in their heather-roofed shielings
on the sheltered sides of the hills, the sheep
and swine were among the pea-ricks, the dusky
smoke of the ruddy winter fire ascended into the
clear blue air from many a happy hearth and
thatched homestead; but, as the roads that
wound over hill and lea were buried deep in snow,
news of the distant war in Spain come slowly and
uncertainly to such remote dwellings as the castle
of Rohallion&mdash;how much more uncertainly and
slowly to those glens in Sutherland and Ross,
where a few heaps of stones amid the desert
waste now mark the birthplaces of those who
manned the ranks of our noblest Scottish
regiments in that old and glorious war.
</p>

<p>
As yet no further tidings had been heard either
of Quentin Kennedy or of his court-martial.  All
that had been heard at home, through the columns
of the London <i>Courier</i>, was that the slender
army of Sir John Moore was falling back before
the overwhelming masses of the enemy, and that
ere long all might be confusion in its
ranks&mdash;perhaps dismay!
</p>

<p>
After the receipt of the Adjutant-General Sir
Harry Calvert's letter, the public papers were
searched in vain for further tidings of Quentin
Kennedy, but none were found.  "Our own
correspondent," with his camp-gossip, had no place
in the newspaper columns of those days.  The mails
were then often late and always uncertain; many
that came by sea were lost between storms and
privateers, and the vague anxiety of Quentin's
friends gradually became painful suspense, and
amid it Lord Rohallion once more <i>wrote with
energy</i> recommending his young protÃ©gÃ© to the
duke.
</p>

<p>
Dinner was over, and the wax-candles in the
candelabra and girandoles of crystal had been
lighted in the antique yellow drawing-room;
Lady Rohallion, seated as usual in her own
corner, was engaged, according to her wont, upon
some piece of knitting or other work for the
poor or old folks on the estate; her grey hair,
somewhat needlessly powdered, was dressed back
as of old.  Lord Rohallion had brought his
decanter of claret with him into the drawing-room
and placed it on a guÃ©ridon table by his side;
and there he sat, in a cushioned easy-chair,
lingering over the wine, and gazing dreamily into
the large fire that blazed in the old-fashioned
brass-basket between the delf-lined jambs of the
fireplace.
</p>

<p>
The wind was sighing through the old
sycamores of the avenue, and the roar of the sea
was heard on the Partan Craig.
</p>

<p>
Flora was idling over the piano, practising the
"Battle of Prague," the Duke of York's grand
march, or some such piece of music then in
vogue with young ladies, and near her hovered
her present admirer, Jack Ferny of Fernwoodlee,
a good-looking but brainless young fellow with
sandy hair and a pea-green hunting-coat of the
fast kind worn when the Pavilion was in its
glory at Brighton.  Ferny's estate was a small
one, and he was evidently, as gossips said, "doing
his best to make ducks and drakes of it."
</p>

<p>
He was strongly addicted to betting, and was
a keen fox-hunter and sportsman.  Beyond the
kennel or the stable he had very few ideas; and so
little capability had he of adapting his conversation
to time, place, or person, that he was now
prosing away to the preoccupied Flora about
sporting matters.
</p>

<p>
First it was of a famous match against time
by the noted pedestrian, Captain Barclay of
Urie; and next, how, when coursing among the
Carrick hills, his two favourite stag-hounds so
pressed a hare they had put up yesterday, that
she leaped down a precipice more than fifty feet
in height, and then the hounds followed without
the slightest hesitation.
</p>

<p>
"Good heavens! they were killed, of course!"
said Flora, looking up with wonder.
</p>

<p>
"Killed, Miss Warrender?&mdash;egad, no!  To
the astonishment of us all, we saw puss and the
hounds scouring along the road towards Maybole;
but the Ayr stage, coming up with four
spanking greys, caused her to make for a field
of grass, and though turned five several times by
the hounds, she made her escape down a burn at
last, for of course they lost the scent."
</p>

<p>
Finding that Flora had relapsed into listlessness,
and that he failed to interest her by his
scraps of information on the Newmarket Craven
meeting, such as his horse Rolla, eight stone,
running against Lord Sackville's Tag, also eight
stone, across the flat for a thousand guineas, and
that three to one was being taken on Rolla; that
the betting was even at Epsom on the brown
colt, by Eclipse, out of Mrs. Fitzherbert, and
other gossip of similar character, he was
compelled to resume his place near the old Lord, who
was just in the act of pressing him politely to
join in another glass of claret, when Jack
Andrews limped in with a letter, which the
running-footman had at that moment brought from
Maybole.  The mail from Ayr had broken down
near the bank of the Boon in the snow, and the
guard had brought on the bags to Dalrymple,
on one of the horses, at the risk of his life.
Oblong and official, the cover of the letter showed
that it was "On His Majesty's service."
</p>

<p>
"News of Quentin Kennedy, doubtless," said
Lord Rohallion, peering about for his eye-glass.
</p>

<p>
"I pray God it be not unfortunate news about
Cosmo!" thought Lady Winifred, for the tidings
that came to many a poor mother in those days of
war were sad enough sometimes.
</p>

<p>
Fernwoodlee, who had seen Quentin Kennedy,
and knew the rumours concerning him and Flora,
observed with annoyance that she was pale and
colourless with ill-concealed interest, as she drew
near Lord Rohallion, who on opening the missive
found, to his no small surprise, that it referred
neither to Quentin nor Cosmo, but to <i>himself</i>,
and was from Sir Harry Calvert, who wrote, that
"by the direction of his Royal Highness the
Field-Marshal Commanding-in-Chief, he had the
pleasure to acquaint him that his lordship's repeated
applications and wishes for command of a brigade
could now be gratified, and that his name would
appear in the next <i>Gazette</i>; and that as troops
were being assembled in great force at Shorncliffe
camp, his Royal Highness hoped that his lordship
would, within a week, be ready to set out for
that place, where his services were greatly required,
and where his proper staff would be selected."
</p>

<p>
This announcement fell with a startling effect
upon Lord and Lady Rohallion.
</p>

<p>
"Appointed to a brigade&mdash;a brigade for foreign
service!  My dear Reynold, you cannot for a
moment think of accepting this command?" said
Lady Winifred, anxiously taking his right hand
between her own.
</p>

<p>
"I applied for it, as you are aware, dearest,
repeatedly."
</p>

<p>
"About the time of the first unhappy expedition
to Egypt; but you have long since relinquished all
idea of serving again, and now&mdash;now, Reynold&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I am bound to accept it, Winny," said he,
with more of sadness than of his old enthusiasm
in his tone.  "I am well up the list of
major-generals," he added, with a faint smile, "and
must do something for promotion.  I may be a
field-marshal yet, Winny, and a K.G. to boot."
</p>

<p>
Perhaps in his secret heart he would rather have
wished that this command had not been offered
him; he felt that he was rather old now, rather
staid and formed in habit, and that he had too
long settled down into the easy tenor of a quiet
country life to care for the hurly-burly and
anxiety of leading a brigade&mdash;it might ultimately
be a division&mdash;in the field; but he knew that
honour and duty compelled him to accept it.
</p>

<p>
Thus he wrote to the adjutant-general that
very night accepting the command, and again
urging that something should be done for his
young protÃ©gÃ©, Quentin Kennedy.
</p>

<p>
The letter left by the mail next morning, and
Lord Rohallion prepared to bid farewell once
more to the old mansion of his forefathers, and to
buckle on the same sword that he had drawn on
the plains of Minden, when a stripling ensign,
forty-nine years before.
</p>

<p>
It was with sad forebodings that Lady Rohallion
prepared to break up her quiet and happy household,
and bid farewell to friends and neighbours, for she
proposed, in the first instance, to accompany her dear
old husband to Shorncliffe, and Flora, their ward,
who could not be left behind, to the unmistakable
dismay of young Fernwoodlee, was to go with them.
</p>

<p>
She was the only one who felt any pleasure in
the anticipated change and long journey by post-horses,
as it promised at least all that novelty so
charming to a young girl.
</p>

<p>
Poor Lady Rohallion!  She knew that by her
husband's frequently expressed desire for
military employment (parliamentary and diplomatic
matters he detested) he was bound in honour&mdash;especially
at a time when all Britain was in arms&mdash;to
accept the first command offered him by the
Duke of York, his old friend and comrade.  She
had long feared the crisis, but, as time passed on
and no appointment came, she ceased to think of
it; but now it had come at last, and when least
expected, and she was about to be subjected to a
double separation, from her husband and her son.
</p>

<p>
Cut off as Britain was then from the continent,
the majority of its people had few views or sympathies
beyond their own fireside or immediate circle.
The scene of the probable campaign in which
Rohallion would serve, was wild and remote, the
people desperate and lawless; our force in the field
small, most pitifully so, when compared with the
masses of the dreaded and then abhorred French.
</p>

<p>
She could perceive that her courtly old lord
vacillated between sincere sorrow for leaving her
and a love for his profession, with a hope of
distinguishing himself and trying his strength and
skill against some of the famous marshals of the
new empire&mdash;the heroes of the Italian, German,
and Egyptian campaigns&mdash;those corporals of le
petit caporal, who had picked up their epaulettes
on the barricades of Paris, or at the foot of the
guillotine on which King Louis and the noblest
in France died; for thus were the marshal dukes
of the great emperor viewed by the high-flying
aristocracy of the Pitt administration, in the old
fighting days "when George the Third was king."
</p>

<p>
Lord Cockburn, in his "Memorials," describes,
with happy fidelity, "a singular race of old
Scottish ladies," that have completely passed away.
"They were," says he, "a delightful set;
strong-headed, warm-hearted, and high-spirited; the
fire of their tempers not always latent; merry
even in solitude; very resolute; indifferent about
the modes and habits of the modern world, and
adhering to their own ways, so as to stand out
like primitive rocks above ordinary society.  Their
prominent qualities of sense, humour, affection,
and spirit, were embodied in curious outsides, for
all dressed, and spoke, and did exactly as they
chose; their language, like their habits, entirely
Scottish, but without any other vulgarity than
what perfect naturalness is sometimes taken for."
</p>

<p>
One of that genuine race was the handsome
and stately old Lady Winifred of Rohallion.
</p>

<p>
A Scottish lady of the kindly old school, one
who in infancy had been nursed and fondled by
warm-hearted and periwigged old gentlemen and
hoopskirted gentlewomen, who boasted that they
were the last of the true old Scots, born when a
Stuart was on the throne, and before their country
was sold by the Whigs, and when her Parliament
assembled on the ringing of St. Gileses bell; she
who in girlhood had seen and known many of
the gallant and loyal who had dined and drunk
with Kilmarnock and Balmerino, and who had
drawn their swords for James VIII. at Falkirk
and Culloden; who treasured in secret the white
rose, and yearly drank to "the king ower the
water"&mdash;she felt now that she would be sadly at a
loss and strange among English modern society.
Her local ideas and usefulness, her strong
Jacobite sympathies and loyalty to a dead race of
kings, her nervous terror of democracy and
foreigners, might pass for eccentricity; but how
could those among whom she would now be
thrown know or understand her little weakness
for the heraldry, genealogy, connexions, and past
glories of the Maxwells of Nithsdale and the
Crawfords of Rohallion; for she knew them to
be people who spoke of the late cardinal-duke as
"the dead Pretender;" who voted all that was not
English absurd or vulgar, and who basked in the
rays of the star of Brunswick as it beamed on
the breast of "the first gentleman in Europe,"
the future George IV.: with her powder and
patches, her broad Scottish accent, and her
high-heeled shoes, she felt that she would be, in such an
atmosphere, an anachronism&mdash;a fish out of water!
</p>

<p>
These minor considerations of self, however,
were completely merged or lost eventually in
distress at the prospect of being separated from her
husband, and in dread of the perils and hardships
he might have to encounter at the seat of war&mdash;at
his advanced years, too!
</p>

<p>
To add to her anxiety, the death-watch had
ticked for several nights in the four-poster of
the great old state bedroom, and this devilish
little pediculus wrought the good lady as much
alarm as Sir Harry Calvert's missive from the
Horse Guards had done.
</p>

<p>
Amid all this, Flora's chief thought was, that at
Shorncliffe she would be nearer Quentin Kennedy,
by the entire length nearly of Britain, and as Lord
Rohallion was to pass through London, he would
see the Duke of York personally about him and
his prospects.
</p>

<p>
The last night they were to spend in the old
castle was a wild, cold, and bitter one.  The waves
of the Firth of Clyde boiled in mountains of white
foam over the Partan Craig, and as Elsie Irvine
said, "the yowls of the sealghs were heard on the
wind, just as they were on the nicht that Quentin
was shipwrecked, and a' body kent they were
never heard for nocht."
</p>

<p>
The tempest roared round the snow-clad promontory
on which the old castle stood, and on this
night one of the oldest sycamores in the avenue
was uprooted with a mighty crash by the wind, an
omen decidedly of coming woe.  Black clouds
sailed like ghostly ships across the otherwise clear
frosty sky, and in the distance the scud and the
ocean blended together in storm and darkness.
</p>

<p>
On that night, the <i>last</i> they were to spend in
their old home, sleep scarcely visited the eyes of
either Lady Rohallion or her husband.
</p>

<p>
She was full of melancholy forebodings, tears,
and prayers, the result of her education and
temperament, and she was thinking of Flora's parents,
of John Warrender of Ardgour, who fell in
Egypt, and of his widow's broken heart; while in
Lord Rohallion's mind, real regret for the coming
separation was mingling with anxieties and little
vanities about how he would handle his brigade
in the field, as he had so long grown "rusty."
</p>

<p>
As the morning dawned&mdash;the morning of a
clear and bright December day, Lady Winifred's
spirits rose a little, especially after the sun burst
forth auspiciously from the parting clouds.
</p>

<p>
The poor quartermaster was heart-broken with
the idea of being left behind; but he had the
household to look after, and all the live stock,
including Quentin's terrier and Flora's birds, all
of which she solemnly committed to his care.
</p>

<p>
On this morning, when they were to set out,
trunks, mails, imperials, and all the usual
incumbrances of a long journey were borne forth to the
haunted gate where the carriage stood, with its four
horses pawing the hard frosty ground, and their
breath ascending like steam, in the clear cold air.
Old Jack Andrews limped about, whistling the
point of war, with uncommon vigour, and with
a new lightness in his eye and step, at the
prospect of seeing military life again.
</p>

<p>
All the tenantry of the estate and the fishermen
of the hamlet mustered at the old castle-gate, and
the Rohallion volunteers, all in full uniform, with
cocked-hats and pigtails, were there in honour of the
brave old Brigadier and his gentle lady; and there
too, were all the household, from bluff Mr. Spillsby
the butler, to John Legate, the long, lean
running-footman, and all looked sad and downhearted.
</p>

<p>
The dominie had overnight prepared a long Latin
address to read on the occasion, but happily for all
concerned, he had left it behind him; and now his great
horn barnacles were obscured and dim, as he lifted
his old three-cornered castor and kissed her
ladyship's hand with profound reverence and affection,
and then Miss Flora's, as they were assisted by
Fernwoodlee and the quartermaster into the carriage.
</p>

<p>
"Farewell, dominie," said the old Lord, as he
shook the good man's hand.  "I'll expect you
to write me sometimes, and tell us how all the
folk here and the school bairns are coming on."
</p>

<p>
"Woe is me, Rohallion! and you are again
going to follow the drum!" he replied, shaking
his queue and queer old wig: "it was invented
by Bacchus, who, as Polysenus declares, used it
first in the Indian war, but from the sorrow
created by its sound, I verily believe its inventor
to be the devil&mdash;the great author of the bagpipe."
</p>

<p>
"Hush, dominie," said his lordship, laughing,
"for here comes Pate of Maybole."
</p>

<p>
This was the piper of the barony town, in the
burgh livery, who now appeared; and as the
coachman whipped up his horses, the sobs of the
servants were drowned in the skirl with which
Pate blew out his bag to the air of the good
Lord Moira's Farewell to Scotland:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "London's bonnie woods and braes,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I maun leave them a', lassie,<br />
  For who can thole when Britain's faes,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wad gie Britons law, lassie?"<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
And striding as only a Scottish piper strides and
swaggers, he played before the carriage down the
avenue and out upon the high road; while there
was not an eye unmoistened at that time-worn castle
gate, as its old lord and his lady went forth upon
their way "to the wars in the far-awa land."
</p>

<p>
It was a silent house that night in Rohallion.

</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
On the llth of December the division of Sir
John Hope quitted Alva and marched towards
Tordesillas.
</p>

<p>
By this time Sir John Moore had discovered
that Bonaparte, abandoning his project of entering
the southern provinces, was on the march to
intercept his retreat towards the sea-coast and
Portugal, while another column was advancing
against him from the direction of Burgos.
</p>

<p>
To frustrate a design that might prove so fatal
to his slender army, Moore was compelled to
relinquish all hope of fighting the Duke of
Dalmatia; so, countermanding the order for the
advance of his various divisions, he requested
Romana to defend the bridge of Mansilla-de-los-Mulos,
and while he fell back towards the Douro,
ordered all the heavy baggage to be conveyed to
Astorga.
</p>

<p>
On hearing of these movements, Bonaparte
exclaimed energetically to Soult, who related it
to Major Charles Napier of the 43rd&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"<i>Moore is the only general now fit to contend
with me; I shall advance against him in person.</i>"
</p>

<p>
Marching to his left, Moore crossed the Douro
at Toro, to form a junction with Sir David Baird
on the 21st December at Vallada.  On the day
before this, near the magnificent Abbey of
Sahagun, nine hundred French cavalry pressing on,
were met by four hundred of ours under Lord
Paget, who repulsed them by one brilliant
charge, sabreing thirty, and taking two hundred
and sixty prisoners.
</p>

<p>
Bonaparte advanced with his main body, a
hundred thousand strong, by four routes, towards
Benevente, along roads buried deep in snow,
through which, by force or bribery, he had
thousands of Spanish labourers cutting pathways, for
the winter had set in with unusual rigour; but
the division of Sir John Hope, whose cavalry and
artillery suffered much by the loss of their horses,
which died fast of the glanders, entered the town
before him on the 24th of the same month.
</p>

<p>
The sufferings of the army during this retreat
towards the north-west angle of Spain were very
great, and the regimental officers were compelled
to carry their personal effects&mdash;at least such as
were absolutely necessary&mdash;about with them in
bags or knapsacks, for the baggage animals
(carts there were none) died, or were lost by the
way.  All bandsmen, batsmen, servants, and
grooms were very properly turned into the ranks,
as Moore had resolved that there should be available
<i>as many muskets as possible</i>.  Seven officers
had but one tent, and every mounted officer had
to groom and rub down his own horse: arrangements
whereat the grumbling, from the staff
particularly, was deep if not loud.  The rations
were also diminished: but of all the corps none
suffered less than the Highland regiments.  After
marching hundreds of miles through snow, rain,
and storm, by roads unchanged since the Moors
traversed them, the 79th and 92nd particularly
had never a man on the sick-list, a fact attributable
either to their native hardihood or the serviceable
nature of their costume.
</p>

<p>
Snow was falling heavily as Hope's division
entered the crumbling mud walls of the small
and miserable town of Benevente in Leon, where
the officers and men, irrespective of rank, crowded
for shelter into the houses and the castle, while a
line of cavalry picquets with a few pieces of
artillery, held the bridge of Orviegro.
</p>

<p>
Weary and foot-sore, Quentin, after cleaning
his musket, flung himself on a heap of straw in
one of the rooms of that wonderful old castle
which is the residence of the Dukes of Ossuna,
and which Southey, in his letters from Spain,
describes as one of the finest monuments of
the age of Spanish chivalry, adding, "we have
nothing in England which approaches to its
grandeur.  Berkeley, Raby, even Warwick and
Windsor, are poor fabrics in comparison."
</p>

<p>
Projecting from a wall, a gigantic arm and hand
in armour sustain a magnificent lamp to light the
grand staircase of the castle.
</p>

<p>
Its open galleries and horse-shoe Saracenic
arches, that spring from fluted and twisted columns
of porphyry and granite; its long aerial-like
cloisters, with jasper pillars, jagged arches, and
tessellated floors; its recessed seats, deep niches, and
canopied alcoves, covered with quaint arabesques
in scarlet, blue, and gold, were now crowded by
wet, weary, and almost shoeless (certainly shirtless)
infantry, who piled their muskets or heaped up
their knapsacks and camp kettles, without heed, in
those noble apartments, where they smoked and
made fires of whatever they could lay hands on;
many a gilded chair became fuel, and pictures by
Velasquez, Murillo, and other eminent painters of
the Spanish school, were torn from the walls, and,
with a curse on the Spaniards, rolled up and thrust
under a pot of rice soup.
</p>

<p>
In fact, the troops were now fast becoming
reckless, and everything that was combustible was
destroyed on this occasion, the family archives
of the Dukes of Ossuna alone escaping.
</p>

<p>
Maddened by cold and hunger, they cared not
how they made themselves comfortable for the
night; but with the first peep of dawn, the report
of cannon was heard at the bridge, the bugles
sounded the turn-out, and hundreds of hoarse
voices were heard shouting,
</p>

<p>
"Stand to your arms! turn out!  The enemy
are coming on&mdash;the out-picquets are engaged!"
</p>

<p>
The division got under arms to continue its
retreat, which the flank companies were ordered
to cover by forming in front of the town; and
so came in this dreary 25th of December.
</p>

<p>
"A merry Christmas and a happy new year!"
cried Monkton to Quentin, as the grenadiers of
Askerne left the battalion double-quick, and just in
time to witness a very brilliant cavalry encounter.
</p>

<p>
It was about the hour of nine in the morning,
and from the slope on which Benevente stands,
they could see in a little plain below the bridge
of the Orviegro, three squadrons of the Imperial
Guard led by a dashing officer in a furred pelisse,
skirmishing with the out-picquets of the light
cavalry, and endeavouring to cross the river by a
ford there.  The red flashing of the carbines on
both sides was incessant; in the clear frosty air
the reports rang sharply, and the figures of the
Imperial Light Cavalry, in their brilliant uniforms,
were distinctly visible upon the spotless
background of snow.  No one was hit on either side,
however, as the dragoon is seldom much of a shot.
</p>

<p>
But suddenly two squadrons of the splendid
10th Hussars, by order of Lord Paget, and led by
Brigadier-General Stewart, defiled out of Benevente
to support the picquets, their loose scarlet pelisses
and plumes waving as they galloped along, and
rapidly forming line, they advanced with a loud
hurrah, and keeping their horses well in hand,
lest they should be blown, against the Chasseurs Ã 
Cheval of the Guard, who drew up on the crest
of an eminence to receive them.
</p>

<p>
Many who looked on held their breath, and
excitement repressed the rising cheer as the
adverse lines of cavalry met!  There was a mingled
yell and hurrah; the long straight swords of the
French on one side, and the crooked sabres of the
10th on the other, all uplifted, flashed keenly in
the morning sun; then there was a terrible shock;
hussars and chasseurs were all mingled in a wild
tumultuous mass, and on both sides horses and
men went down among bloody and trodden snow;
but the French fled at full speed, leaving the
ground strewed with killed and wounded men,
and encumbered by scared horses that rushed
about with empty saddles.
</p>

<p>
Eighty-five French Chasseurs and fifty of our
smart Hussars were lying there dead or writhing
in all the agony of sword wounds among the snow;
but with loud cheers the survivors came trotting
into Benevente, bringing with them seventy
dismounted prisoners, among whom was the leader
of the French, superbly dressed in a green uniform
that had a profusion of gold and fur trimming upon
it.  He was led forward between two Hussars,
who had each his carbine resting on his thigh.
</p>

<p>
"Paget," exclaimed Brigadier-General Sir
Charles Stewart, hurrying up at a canter,
"allow me to present you with a valuable
prisoner.  We have just had the honour to take
Lieutenant-General Lefebre Desnouettes,
commander of the cavalry of the Imperial Guard."
</p>

<p>
Lord Paget bowed very low to the captive.
</p>

<p>
Pale, exhausted, and covered with sword-cuts,
he was the picture of a soldier; and his eyes had
that keen, bright, almost wolfish expression,
peculiar to those who have recently stared the
grim King of Terrors face to face on the battlefield.
He was led away, and was soon after presented
to Sir John Moore, to whom he spoke
with intense bitterness of his own defeat.
</p>

<p>
"Bonaparte," said he, "is the minion of
fortune; he never forgives the unfortunate, but
ever believes them culpable!"
</p>

<p>
Moore sought to console him, and presented
him with a splendid oriental scimitar, which
Lefebre ever after preserved with gratitude, and
wore in England, whither he was despatched at
once in charge of Captain Wyndham, one of the
general's aides-de-camp.
</p>

<p>
The division continued its retreat by the ruined
walls and mouldering citadel of Astorga, and Villa
Franca del Bierzo, and, though many perished by
the way, Quentin Kennedy, endowed by spirit
and enthusiasm rather than bodily strength, bore
up manfully amid the fatigue, the privations, and
the horrors of that long and devious retreat of so
many hundred miles, along roads covered with
deep snow, over steep and rugged mountain
sierras, through half-frozen rivers, where the
bridges had been broken down or blown up, and
by narrow defiles, followed by an enthusiastic
enemy, whose well-victualled force, outnumbering
by three times that of Moore, came on fast
and surely, with flying artillery, lightly-armed
dragoons, and pestilent little Voltigeurs, skirmishing
every foot of the way&mdash;the sharp ringing of
carbines and the boom of field-pieces being the
invariable close of each day's march, and the
prelude to its resumption in the cold, dark early
morning, when the cavalry rear-guard held the
advance of the foe in check, till the jaded and
half-slept infantry pushed on, and on, and
on&mdash;hopeless, heartless, and in rags, leaving, en route,
in the form of dead and dying men, women,
children, and horses, traces of the havoc that
neglect and disaster were making in the ranks,
for now the Spanish authorities omitted utterly
to supply the troops with either billets or rations,
or any necessary provisions.
</p>

<p>
A junction of Hope's division with the main
body of the British army was effected, however;
on the 31st of December, Moore quitted Astorga
with his famine-stricken force, and so hot and
fierce was the pursuit, that on the following day,
the first of the new year, Napoleon entered the
little town at the head of eighty thousand horse
and foot, with two hundred pieces of cannon,
while many thousand bayonets more were on the
march to join him!
</p>

<p>
The Emperor, however, went no further than
Astorga, for there he left to Soult&mdash;to use his
own inflated words&mdash;"the glorious mission of
destroying the British&mdash;of pursuing them to the
point of embarkation, and driving them into the sea!"
</p>

<p>
And the state of matters we have described
continued until the army reached Lugo, after a
five days' march through a rugged and savage
country.

CHAPTER XIV.
<br /><br />
FRESH DISASTERS.
</h3>

<p class="intropoem">
  "Oh, plenteous England! comfort's dwelling-place<br />
  Blest be thy well-fed, glossy, John-Bull face!<br />
  Blest be the land of Aldermanic paunches,<br />
  Rich turtle-soup, and glorious ven'son haunches!<br />
  Inoculated by mad martial ardour,<br />
  Why did I ever quit thy well-stored larder?<br />
  Why, fired with scarlet-fever, in ill time,<br />
  Come here to fight and starve in this accursed clime?"<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
On this march the army was in arrears of pay, so
Quentin's remaining moidores soon melted away,
as he shared them, to the last vintin, fraternally
with his friends and comrades; but long ere the
army reached Lugo, he saw many a strange and
startling episode of horror and suffering.
</p>

<p>
Moore's troops continued to make forced
marches to prevent the foe from closing on their
flanks, and now every day provisions grew scarcer.
</p>

<p>
The skies were lowering, and heavy clouds
rested on the tops of the gloomy mountains; the
rough, narrow, and wretched roads were knee-deep
in drifted snow; half-famished and half-frozen,
the soldiers became desperate, and, in
defiance of Moore's orders, plundered whatever
they could get to satisfy the cravings of nature.
</p>

<p>
From Astorga to Villa Franca (in the mountain
district called the Bierzo&mdash;so lovely in summer), is
a route of fully sixty English miles, through wild
and savage mountain tracts and passes, where
the horses failed, as their shoes were worn away;
but though there were plenty of iron-works near
Villa Franca, there was no time to re-shoe them,
so every hour saw whole sections of our noble
English horses shot down, lest they should fall
into the hands of the pursuing enemy; and then
the dismounted troopers had to trudge on foot,
laden with all their useless trappings.
</p>

<p>
One of the 3rd Light Dragoons of the German
Legion, whose horse had been shot according to
the usage of war, was urged by Major Burgwesel
to go on faster.
</p>

<p>
"Herr Major," said he, "the game is pretty
well played out with me, and if you expect me to
march quicker with all this load, you may as
well shoot me as you have done my poor horse."
</p>

<p>
"Himmel und Erde, get on, fellow!" shouted
the major, with an angry malediction.
</p>

<p>
On this, the exasperated dragoon placed a
pistol to his mouth and blew out his brains, to
the horror of the stern major.
</p>

<p>
Now came rain in torrents, and even the baggage
had to be dragged through the melting snow,
as the mules and burros perished in scores by the
way.  Then the spare arms were abandoned and
the extra ammunition destroyed; next, knapsacks
were cast away occasionally, and everything that
might serve to lighten the burden of the despairing
soldiers, many of whom were found frozen
and dead in the bodegas and cellars of Villa
Franca by the French advanced guard.
</p>

<p>
A mile beyond this place, poor Ensign Pimple
(as Monkton used to call him) gave in, utterly
incapable of proceeding further; weeping like a child,
in utter prostration, he sank in exhaustion by the
wayside, and no doubt perished during the night.
</p>

<p>
After passing Benvibre the French cavalry
came up with the long line of stragglers in the
rear, and slashed among them right and left,
treading others under foot as they galloped
through, and so stupefied were some by fatigue
and others by intoxication, that they could neither
resist nor seek safety in flight.  Two thousand
were taken prisoners between Astorga and Lugo;
a thousand more fled away towards Portugal;
many of these were concealed by the Spaniards,
and few were ever heard of again.
</p>

<p>
So on and on the army toiled from Villa
Franca to Castro up the Monte del Cebrero, a
long and continued ascent, through one of the
wildest districts in Spain, where, in summer,
woods of umbrageous oak, alder, and hazel, with
groves of wild pears, cherries, and mulberries,
make the landscape lovely; but now it was wild
and desolate; and there, to add to other misfortunes,
the sick and wounded had to be abandoned
among the melting snow.
</p>

<p>
On the sloping road towards Castro-Gonzalo,
Askerne found a poor rifleman of the old 95th
lying on his back, and blowing bells of blood
from his mouth; he had been riddled by canister
shot, and all his limbs were broken.
</p>

<p>
"Unfortunate fellow," said he, with commiseration:
"what can I do for you?"
</p>

<p>
"Have me shot, sir&mdash;shot dead, for the mercy
of God!" was the terrible reply.
</p>

<p>
"I looked round," says an officer in one of his
letters, "when we had hardly gained the highest
point of those slippery precipices, and saw the
rear of the army winding along the narrow
road&mdash;I saw the way marked by the wretched people,
who lay on all sides expiring from fatigue and
the severity of the cold; their bodies reddened
in spots the white surface of the ground."
</p>

<p>
There a Portuguese bullock driver who had
been with the British since the landing of the
army, was seen dying amid the snow on his
knees, with his hands clasped in an attitude of
prayer before a little wooden crucifix, a consolation
not left to the hundreds of our soldiers, who
were flinging themselves down in utter despair to
die, with curses and bitter imprecations on their
lips&mdash;curses on the Spaniards, who, they fancied,
had betrayed them.
</p>

<p>
And there, too, were women and little children!
</p>

<p>
About nightfall, just as the grenadiers of the
Borderers struggled up the Monte del Cebrero
through all the horrible dÃ©bris that the columns
in front had left behind, they passed several of
the sick and artillery waggons, broken down or
abandoned by the wayside.  In these were many
soldiers' wives and sick men dead and frozen!
</p>

<p>
In one was a woman in labour dying, with
her infant, amid the icy drift; in another a
woman already dead, with a wailing infant
tugging at her white cold breast.  The little one
was taken by good old Sergeant-major Calder,
who wrapped it in his great-coat, but it died of cold
ere the summit of the mountain was attained.
</p>

<p>
From one of those covered sick-waggons that
lay broken down and abandoned among the snow
and sleet, there came the sound of a strange
wailing song sung by a woman.  This prompted
Quentin to leave the ranks, which were somewhat
irregular now, and peep in.  There he found a
soldier of the 25th lying dead, and his wife, with
their child, sitting by his side, in misery.  They
formed a touching group!
</p>

<p>
She was evidently deranged by suffering, terror,
and sorrow, and she was a pretty young woman,
too.  She heard not the wailing of the infant
that nestled among the wet straw by her side,
but sat with her husband's head in her lap, and
her hollow eyes fixed on vacancy, as she toyed
with his hair, and "crooned" a fragment of an
old Scottish song to a plaintive air, somewhat
like that of "My Love's in Germanie."
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "They say my love is dead,<br />
  Gone to his gory bed,<br />
  They say my love is dead,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ayont the sea.<br />
  In the stillness o' the night,<br />
  When the moon is shining bright,<br />
  My true-love's shroud sae white<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Haunteth me,<br />

  My true love's shroud sae white<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Haunteth me!"<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"Good heavens, sir," said a soldier, "it is poor
Allan Grange, the sergeant who was broken at
Colchester, and his wife, too!  She's clean
demented, puir thing!  Ailie, woman, come awa;
the regiment is moving on."
</p>

<p>
Quentin too, tried his powers of persuasion,
but without avail, and the stern order of Cosmo,
to "Close up&mdash;close up, and move on&mdash;no loitering!"
together with the distant boom of a French
field-piece, the flash of which came redly through
the drift and darkness, compelled them to leave
her.  If she lived she must soon after have fallen
into the hands of the enemy.  At all events,
Ailie Grange was heard of no more.
</p>

<p>
In one of the many skirmishes with the enemy's
light dragoons, a singular instance of gross
treachery occurred at the little village of Palacios de
la Valduerna.  There a sergeant of our 7th
Hussars, belonging to Captain Duckinfield's
detachment, vanquished, in single combat, a French
dragoon and took him prisoner.  The Frenchman
threw down his sword, drew off his leather gauntlet,
and held out his hand in token of amity.  Then
the sergeant, with the characteristic generosity of
a gallant Englishman, also put forth his right
hand; but inserting his left into his holster, the
Frenchman drew a pistol, blew his captor's wrist
to pieces, and killed his horse under him.
</p>

<p>
Before the poor hussar could rise from under
his fallen charger, the would-be assassin was
bayoneted by some of Romana's Spanish soldiers,
who in their rage and hatred, made up a fire and
consumed his body to ashes; after this, in blind
vengeance, they somewhat needlessly slew his
horse.
</p>

<p>
At this part of the disastrous retreat nearly a
hundred waggons that were coming on, laden
with shoes and clothes for Romana's Spaniards,
from England, but too late to be of any avail, fell
into the hands of the enemy.
</p>

<p>
As the column defiled past them, Quentin saw
the body of an officer lying dead under one of the
wheels in a pool of blood, snow, and mire.  A
vague recollection, combined with a horrible
anxiety, made him draw near to observe the corpse.
</p>

<p>
It was that of Warriston! his kind and
generous friend, Captain Richard Warriston, of
the Scots Brigade; but "push on&mdash;push on,"
was the order, and there was no time given for
thought, examination, or inquiry........
</p>

<p>
On, and on yet! and at last it was found
necessary, at Nogales, to abandon the military chest.
Why its contents were not distributed among the
troops it is difficult to say, unless that time would
have been lost by the process of division.  Two
bullock-carts, laden with twenty-five thousand
pounds in dollars, were backed over a lofty
precipice, and fell crashing from the summit among
the rocks and snow beneath; and then as the
waggons broke and the casks burst, the broad
silver dollars flew far and wide.
</p>

<p>
It was hoped that this money would escape the
observation of the French, and so fall into the
hands of the Spaniards.  Part was found by the
former, part by the Gallician peasantry, and a
Highland tradition tells us of a thrifty Scots
paymaster who contrived to conceal a cask or two
under a certain cork-tree, where he found the
specie all safe when he went back to Spain for it,
after Toulouse; and that he bought therewith a
snug little estate on the shore of the Moray
Firth.
</p>

<p>
At the very time that the bullock-carts with
the treasure were cast over the precipice, by some
absurd mistake, Quentin's battalion, with two
pieces of cannon, were engaged with the enemy in
order <i>to protect it</i>!
</p>

<p>
Evening was coming on, and shimmering
through the slanting sheet, a cloud of French
cavalry passed along the snowy and miry way,
while the two field guns were ploughing lanes of
death through their ranks; but still with brandished
sabres and cries of "Vive la France!  Vive
l'Empereur!" they came on thundering to the
attack.
</p>

<p>
"Square against cavalry!" was now the cry;
"square on the grenadiers!"
</p>

<p>
It was formed double-quick, and a smile of
grim joy spread over every sallow and weather-beaten
face as the toil-worn and tattered regiment
made the movement, enclosing many of the
wounded foes as well as friends.  The light
company formed the rear face of the square.
</p>

<p>
Cosmo was undoubtedly brave, for a lofty
expression of pride and defiance spread over his
features on beholding the rapidity with which
the square was formed.  Jolly old Middleton drew
off his gloves and stuck them in his belt; he
then flourished an enormous sabre, so rusty and
notched in the edge that it was known as "Jock
Middleton's hand-saw," saying&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"I like to use my tools, lads, without mittens;
the cat that wore gloves never caught mice."
</p>

<p>
The officers dressed the four faces as well as
the shattered and unequal state of the companies
could form them now.  Sending a last discharge
of grape plunging into the masses of the foe, the
gunners rushed for shelter behind the wall of
bayonets, and now through the gloom of evening,
the wrack, mist, and smoke, on came the French
dragoons like rolling thunder!
</p>

<p>
As the ground was tolerably open the square
was approached on three faces.
</p>

<p>
Against one was a brigade of cuirassiers, their
brass helmets with scarlet plumes and brass
corslets with elaborate shoulder-belts all dimmed
by rain; opposed to another was the Lancer
Regiment of Napoleon-Louis, the hereditary
Duc de Berg, with white plumes and kalpecks
in their busbies; and on the third face came the
Light Dragoons of Ribeaupierre, in pale green
lapelled with white and laced with silver, their
tricolors waving above a forest of flashing sabres.
</p>

<p>
Quentin felt his heart beating wildly as they
came on.  In the square, every eye lit up, every
brow was knit, and every lip compressed; but
not a shot was fired until the foe was within
pistol-range, when, from the faces of the square, there
opened a close and disastrous fire, first from the
right to the left, and then it became a wild roar
of musketry, the men loading and firing as fast
as they could, while many a pistol and carbine-shot
took effect in their ranks, and Quentin was
covered by the blood of a man who was killed
thus by his side.
</p>

<p>
Yells of death were mingled with shouts of
rage and defiance, as horse and man went down on
every hand, the front squadrons swerving or
recoiling madly on the rear, thus making all advance
impossible; steeds reared, plunged, and neighed,
their riders groaned, shrieked, and swore; swords,
helmets, shakos, and broken lances were seen
flying into the air, while lancers and cuirassiers,
wounded and dying, were crushed and trodden
flat by hoofs and falling horses.
</p>

<p>
The whole cuirassier brigade became an
undistinguishable mass of confusion and indiscriminate
slaughter; but not a horseman came within
sword's point of that steady and invincible square
of infantry.
</p>

<p>
At that moment, when the firing slackened a
little, the voice of the Master of Rohallion was
heard.
</p>

<p>
"Well done, my brave Borderers! kneeling
ranks, fire a volley&mdash;ready&mdash;present&mdash;<i>fire</i>!"
</p>

<p>
It rang like thunder in the winter air, and
found a thousand echoes among the mountains,
and ere these died away the ruin of the foe was
complete.  This was the first occasion on which
Quentin had fired a shot in grim earnest, and a
thrill passed through his heart as he pulled the
trigger and sent a bullet on its errand, while
ignorant of its effect amid the smoke in front.
</p>

<p>
Ere the butts were again on the earth in their
original position, and the bristling bayonets were
pointed upward, amid the smoke that rolled around
them like a murky curtain, the cavalry were seen
in full flight, leaving a terrible dÃ©bris of death and
bloodshed behind them on the snow-clad mountain
slope.
</p>

<p>
"The battalion will form quarter-distance
column," cried Cosmo, as coolly as if he was in
Colchester again.  Then he ordered the pouches
of the dead and wounded to be emptied, as
ammunition was running short.  The field guns were
then limbered up, and once more the weary retreat
was resumed with all speed.
</p>

<p>
Sergeant Ewen Donaldson, whose leg was shattered
by a carbine-ball, was here left behind, after
some of the soldiers had made an effort to drag
him along with them.
</p>

<p>
"Push on, boys&mdash;push on, and never mind me,"
said the poor fellow; "before morning I shall be
gone to where I'm fast wearin' awa'&mdash;the land o'
the leal."
</p>

<p>
And this, too probably, was the case.
</p>

<p>
The tender and compassionate heart of Sir
John Moore bled at the misery he beheld hourly
on this miserable retreat.  He bitterly deplored
the relaxation of discipline consequent on it, and
he never ceased issuing orders, warm exhortations,
cheering addresses, and stirring appeals to honour
and courage, to keep up the spirit of those under
his command; but despair and sullen apathy
reigned in many instances in officers and men
alike, while the retreat lasted.  But, with all this,
grand and touching instances of humanity were
not wanting to brighten the terrible picture.
</p>

<p>
An infantry officer, in despair of proceeding
further, turned aside into a thicket of trees, to lie
down and die unseen and uncared for; but there
he found a soldier's wife stretched at the point of
death, and, with the last effort of expiring nature,
she implored him to receive and preserve her
child.  He did so, and endued with fresh strength
and energy by the trust, he carried the infant on
his back, and it never quitted his care till he
reached one of the transports in the bay of Vigo,
after the battle of Corunna.*

<p>
At a place where the green coats of the 95th
dotted the snow, showing where a skirmish had
been, Quentin assisted a rifleman to place one of
his comrades in a waggon that stood near.
</p>

<p>
"Tom&mdash;old fellow," said the sufferer, in a weak
voice, for he was dying with a bullet in his chest,
and rustled fatuously among the damp straw on
which they placed him; "I say, Tom&mdash;we've
long been comrades."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Bill," said the other, in a husky voice,
"ever since Copenhagen."
</p>

<p>
"Well, when I'm dead, I want you to do
summut for me, and I'll give you all I have in
the world.  My kit's wore out, ever so long ago,
but I've three biscuits in my havresack, and
you're welcome to them; give one to poor Pat
Riley's widow."
</p>

<p>
"But wot am I to do for you, Bill?"
</p>

<p>
"Close my right eye, Tom; dont'ee forget; the
cursed French knocked t'other out at Vimiera."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Bill&mdash;I was wounded that day, too."
</p>

<p>
Bill's eye was closed, and the snow and the
sods were over him within an hour after this, and
close by Tom sat, munching his legacy, for he
was starving, with his fierce moist eyes fixed on
the little mound where his old comrade lay.

<br /><br />
A SMILE OF FORTUNE.

</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
No music was heard now on that dreary retreat.
The bagpipes of the indomitable Highlanders sent
up their bold, wild skirl at times upon the winter
blast, showing where the Camerons, the Gordon
Highlanders, or the Black Watch trod bare-knee'd
through the snow; but no other quickstep met
the ear; even Leslie's march cheered the Borderers
no more; and many a man among them wished
himself with the other battalions of the corps,
broiling in India, or serving anywhere but in
Spain.
</p>

<p>
To reach their transports and abandon the
country by sea, without risking the slaughter of a
useless battle with those whose numbers were so
overwhelming, was, for a time, the sole object of
the British generals.
</p>

<p>
Disorders usually prevail in a retreating army,
and many circumstances served to augment them
on this occasion.  Our soldiers were enraged by
the apparent apathy or treachery of the Spanish
officials, who withheld all supplies; these latter,
at the same time did not conceal that they believed
themselves to be abandoned by the British to the
enemy, in whose overwhelming numbers, with true
Spanish obstinacy, they refused to believe.
</p>

<p>
Perceiving, however, that unless by some vigorous
resistance he crippled his pursuers, a flight
by sea would be impossible, Sir John Moore
recalled General Fraser's division from the Vigo
road, and on the 6th of January, after a sharp
cavalry encounter at Cacabelos, where Colbert, a
distinguished French general, was killed, he took up
a position near the city of Lugo, on the Minho, in
Gallicia, a place situated on high ground.
</p>

<p>
So pressed were the cavalry, and so dreadfully
had the horses suffered during the retreat, that on
entering Lugo many fell dead beneath their riders,
and others were mercifully shot.  Four hundred
of their carcasses, with bridles, saddles, and
holsters on&mdash;the steeds that whilome had been in the
ranks of our splendid 7th, 10th, 15th, and 18th
Hussars&mdash;lay in the market-place and thoroughfares.
There were none of our soldiers who had
strength to dig trenches deep enough to bury
them; the Spaniards were too lazy or apathetic for
the work, or cared not to attempt it while the
enemy's voltigeurs or sharpshooters were within
sight of their old ruined walls.  Swelling in the
rain, bursting, and putrefying, the bodies lay
there, a prey to herds of devouring dogs, and flocks
of carrion birds.
</p>

<p>
At Lugo the army might have rested for some
days, had the bridges of the now swollen rivers
been blown up; but the mines had failed, and on
the 5th of January the pursuing French came in
sight in force, and at last a battle was looked for.
</p>

<p>
The evening of the 5th proved a very eventful
one for the humble fortunes of our hero, and the
<i>last</i> of his service in the ranks of the King's Own
Borderers.
</p>

<p>
About four in the afternoon, during a partial
cessation of the sleet and rain which had been
incessant for so many days, melting the snow on
the mountains and swelling the rivers, Quentin
found himself posted as an advanced sentinel in
front of the line of out-picquets, near the road
leading from Lugo to Nogales.  Dark clouds
enveloped the mighty range of mountains in the
distance, but from their summits it was known,
by the intelligence of scouts, that the enemy was
descending in force.
</p>

<p>
A blue patch was visible here and there overhead,
through the flying vapour, and there, already
bright and twinkling, a few "sentinel stars set
their watch in the sky."
</p>

<p>
After the slaughter of the worn or half-dead
cavalry horses, all was still, and now not a sound
stirred the air save the tolling of the cathedral
bell in Lugo, or the roar of the Minho, swollen
by a hundred tributaries, and rushing in wild
career through an uncultivated waste of stunted
laurel bushes to mingle with the Atlantic.
</p>

<p>
That day Quentin had tasted no food save a
handful of corn which he received from Major
Middleton, whom he had found fraternally sharing
a feed of it with his now lean and gaunt
Rosinante-looking charger, which he had stabled
under a cork-tree and covered with his blanket,
complimenting himself by the old adage that "a
merciful man is merciful to his beast."
</p>

<p>
Oppressed by the sombre scenery, the drenched
and uncultivated waste, and the gloom of the
December evening, Quentin leaned on his musket, a
prey to a fit of intense despondency, and tears almost
came to his eyes as he thought of all the horrors
he had witnessed since the day on which he landed
at the bay of Maciera, the campaign he had served
so fruitlessly, and of what was before him on
landing, friendlessly, in England.
</p>

<p>
Better it was to die in Spain, like poor
Warriston, whose dead face, as he lay with others,
mangled and doubtless yet unburied, in that
savage mountain waste, amid the melting snows,
came keenly back to memory now!
</p>

<p>
From this unpleasant reverie he was suddenly
roused by seeing a mounted officer, muffled in a
blue cloak, with a plain unplumed cocked-hat,
riding along the chain of advanced sentinels,
questioning or addressing a few words to each, as
if to ascertain that all were on the alert.
</p>

<p>
Gradually he came on, his horse, a lean but
clean-limbed and active bay, picking its way among
the rough stones and stunted laurel bushes.  As
he drew nearer, Quentin could perceive him to be
a general officer, accompanied, at a little distance,
by an orderly sergeant in the blue, white-faced,
and silver-braided uniform of the 18th Hussars.
On his approaching, Quentin "presented arms."
</p>

<p>
"Walk about," said he, while touching his hat.
This is the usual response of an officer when
ceremony is to be waived; but, immediately after,
perceiving by Quentin's uniform&mdash;for the poor
fellow had now parted with his great-coat as well
as his blanket, and in a similar fashion&mdash;that he
was <i>not</i> a private soldier, he came close up to him,
and said, "You are, I presume, aware that the
enemy is in front?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir&mdash;and more immediately, Ribeaupierre's
dragoon brigade and Lallemand's corps."
</p>

<p>
"Exactly," replied the other, with a pleasant
smile; "I like to find a young soldier well-informed
of the work in hand&mdash;that he knows what
he is about, and takes an interest in his profession.
Your regiment is&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"The 25th Foot, sir&mdash;2nd battalion."
</p>

<p>
"You are, I see, a volunteer?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir."
</p>

<p>
"How long have you served?"
</p>

<p>
"Nearly since the campaign opened."
</p>

<p>
"Without promotion, too!"
</p>

<p>
"And likely to be without it now, I fear."
</p>

<p>
"It is somewhat unusual for a volunteer to be
posted as a sentinel," said the other, with a keen
glance.
</p>

<p>
"I go where Colonel Crawford orders me," replied
Quentin; "and if there was much risk, I
spared him the trouble by volunteering readily."
</p>

<p>
"A young fellow of spirit!  Are you born to
a fortune?"
</p>

<p>
"Fortune!" repeated Quentin, with a start, and
in a voice that was very touching; "alas, sir, I
fear that I am born only to <i>failure</i>!"
</p>

<p>
"Failure?" said the other, as his colour deepened.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir&mdash;like our expedition to Spain."
</p>

<p>
The officer seemed much struck by a remark
that appeared to coincide with certain ideas and
fears of destiny that were peculiarly his own.
He knitted his brows, and said&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Young man, you speak very confidently of
the fate of 'this expedition to Spain.'  Do you
know what you are talking about?"
</p>

<p>
"I trust, sir, that I do," replied Quentin, modestly.
</p>

<p>
"Then, perhaps," said the other, with a smile
as he propounded what he deemed a puzzling
question, "you will be good enough to explain the
maxims which guide an expedition by land or sea?"
</p>

<p>
"I shall try," said Quentin, colouring deeply
and seeking to remember some of the old
quartermaster's enthusiastic tutelage.
</p>

<p>
"Do so."
</p>

<p>
"There are, I think, four great maxims."
</p>

<p>
"Yes&mdash;at least, and I shall be glad to hear them."
</p>

<p>
"First, sir, in an armed expedition of any
kind, there should always be secrecy of design,
and also, of all preparation.  Second: the force
and the means employed should always be
proportionate to the <i>end</i> to be achieved; (which is
not <i>our</i> case here, else we had been in Madrid
to-night and not fugitives in Lugo.)  Third: there
is requisite a complete knowledge of the country
for which the expedition is destined; in that at
least our brave Sir John Moore is unequalled.
Fourth: there is required a commander, who like
him has all the turn of mind which is most adapted
for that particular branch of the war."
</p>

<p>
"Upon my honour you are a very singular
young man," replied the other, with something
between a smile and a frown hovering on his fair
and open countenance.  "You might teach CÃ¦sar
himself a lesson; but before you go any further
in your remarks, I think it right to inform you
that <i>I</i> am Lieutenant-General Sir John Moore."
</p>

<p>
Quentin was silenced and petrified.  He felt
sinking with shame at his own confidence and
sudden effrontery, both the offspring of gloomy
disappointment; then he strove to remember all
he had said, and continued to gaze almost stupidly
at the worthy general, who seemed to enjoy the
situation and laughed heartily, and said, in a
manner that was winning and reassuring&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"I wish Davie Baird or Lord Paget had been
with me to hear all this!"
</p>

<p>
Mild in face and disposition, though somewhat
fierce in temper when a boy, Sir John Moore
possessed a figure that was tall and graceful.
His features were perfectly regular; his eyes were
hazel, and his hair of a rich brown colour.  His
whole face was expressive of cheerfulness and
benignity, save at times when a hopeless or
desponding emotion seized his mind.  There was a
very perceptible scar on one of the cheeks, where
his face had been traversed by a bullet when
leading on the 92nd at Egmont-op-Zee.
</p>

<p>
In his holsters he always carried the pistols
given to him by the attainted Earl Marischal, when
he was present, as a young subaltern of the 51st
Foot, at the famous reviews of the Prussian army
near Potsdam, together with a pocket edition of
Horace bearing the Earl's autograph; and these he
valued highly as relics of that sturdy old Jacobite,
once Scotland's premier peer.
</p>

<p>
Moore was now in his forty-eighth year, having
been born at Glasgow, in 1761, in a house long
known as "Donald's Land," in the Trongate&mdash;an
edifice demolished in 1854.  But to resume:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
After enjoying Quentin's confusion for a
moment, he asked&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Are there any other gentlemen volunteers
serving with the Borderers?"
</p>

<p>
"No, sir, myself only."
</p>

<p>
"Indeed!&mdash;what&mdash;are you named Kennedy&mdash;Quentin
Kennedy?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir," replied Quentin, faintly, and his
heart sunk.  ("Oh," thought he, "he has heard
of that accursed court-martial&mdash;who has not?
It is all over with me now!")
</p>

<p>
"Have you not seen the last War Office Gazette,
which came this morning from England?"
</p>

<p>
"No, sir, I am sorry to say that&mdash;that&mdash;" stammered
Quentin, ignorant of what dereliction of duty
might be here inferred; "I only&mdash;that is&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Then get a look of it, and there you will find
yourself gazetted to a lieutenancy in the 7th, or
Royal Fusiliers.  I congratulate you, sir&mdash;your
regiment is at present in England, where I wish
we all were, with honour and safety."
</p>

<p>
Quentin was overwhelmed by this intimation.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, sir, are you sure of this?" exclaimed the
poor lad, trembling with many mingled emotions.
</p>

<p>
"Sure as that I now address you; and if your
name be Quentin Kennedy, serving with the
King's Own Borderers&mdash;full lieutenant in the
corps, which has <i>no other</i> subalterns.  Now you
cannot continue to serve thus&mdash;carrying a musket
with the 25th; other work must be found for you.
When will you be relieved from this post?"
</p>

<p>
"In a few minutes, sir&mdash;my hour is nearly up."
</p>

<p>
"Then you will take a note from me to Crawford,
your colonel," said Moore; and drawing forth
a note book, he rapidly pencilled a note, tore it
out, folded it and addressed it.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"The bearer hereof," it ran, "Mr. Q. Kennedy,
having been appointed by his Majesty to a
lieutenancy in the 7th Fusiliers, will serve on my
personal staff, as an extra aide-de-camp, until he
can join his regiment, now in Britain.
</p>

<p class="noindent">
"JOHN MOORE, Lieut.-Gen."
</p>

<p><br />
</p>

<p>
"You will show this to Colonel Crawford and
to the adjutant-general, with my compliments.
It will be in orders to-morrow.  Wyndham has
gone to London with poor General Lefebre and
the despatches of our cavalry affairs at Sahagun
and Benevente, so I must have your assistance in
his place during this <i>expedition</i>," he added,
smilingly, with an emphasis.  "Captain Hardinge
will lend you a horse&mdash;I know he has some spare
cattle&mdash;meet me at my quarters opposite the
cathedral to-morrow morning early; till then
good-bye, Lieutenant Kennedy, and I wish you
success!"
</p>

<p>
Moore drew off his glove, shook Quentin's
hand with friendly cordiality, and rode away at
a canter, leaving our sentinel in a very bewildered
state of mind indeed.

CHAPTER XVI.
<br /><br />
PIQUE.
</h3>

<p class="intropoem">
  "These hands are brown with toil; that brow is scarred;<br />
  Still must you sweat and swelter in the sun,<br />
  And trudge with feet benumbed the winter snow,<br />
  Nor intermission have until the end.<br />
  Thou canst not draw down fame upon thy head,<br />
  And yet wouldst cling to life!"&mdash;ALEXANDER SMITH.<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"A lieutenant in the 7th, or Royal Fusiliers!&mdash;am
I actually so?" was the question Quentin
asked of himself repeatedly.
</p>

<p>
There could be no doubt about it; the general
had said so, and the Gazette confirmed it, that
he, Quentin Kennedy, volunteer with the 25th
Foot, had been appointed to that regiment, one of
the oldest corps of the line&mdash;a "crack one,"
too&mdash;commanded by General Sir Alured Clark, G.C.B.
Long known as the <i>South British Fusiliers</i>, to
distinguish them from the Scottish corps and
the famous Welsh Fusiliers, armed with the same
weapon, the 7th were without officers of the
rank of ensign until a year or two ago; thus, at
the time we refer to, their two battalions had no
less than sixty-four lieutenants.
</p>

<p>
This sudden promotion, which put him so
completely beyond the power of his rival and enemy,
the Master of Rohallion, and which gave him
independence and a position in society too,
puzzled Quentin for a time; but briefly so, as
reflection showed him that he must owe it to the
great interest possessed by Lord Rohallion, who,
he was aware, had now traced him to the Borderers;
and this, indeed, was the secret of the
whole affair.
</p>

<p>
And Flora Warrender&mdash;she must have seen his
appointment in the Gazette long before it had
thus casually met the sharp eye of Sir John
Moore, and could he doubt that she rejoiced at
the event?
</p>

<p>
To be raised at once from a position so
subordinate and anomalous, so unrecognised and so
fraught with useless peril as that of a gentleman
volunteer, from the ranks as it were of that army
whose dreadful sufferings he shared and whose
many dangers he risked&mdash;to be raised to the rank
of an officer in a regiment so distinguished as
the Royal Fusiliers, and to be at once, temporarily
though it were, placed on the general's
staff, and beyond the reach of Cosmo's coldness,
pique, and hauteur, was indeed to be independent,
and to taste of happiness supreme!
</p>

<p>
His heart was full of joy, of enthusiasm, and
gratified ambition; but sincere gratitude and
increased regard for the kind and fatherly old Lord
to whom he owed it were not wanting now; and
Quentin resolved to write a letter pouring out his
thanks, and expressive of all he felt, on the first
opportunity.  He was right to make the last
reserve mentally, for opportunities for committing
one's lucubrations to paper were sadly wanting
now when within musket shot of the French
advanced guard.
</p>

<p>
He was full of genuine regard for the good
and great Sir John Moore, full of enthusiastic
devotion, gratitude, and admiration, too!  How
was it possible that he could feel otherwise?
Apart from the news of his promotion in life,
which must soon have reached him, he blessed the
chance which made his informant the resolute
and gallant leader of the British army!
</p>

<p>
After obtaining the warm congratulations of
those who were his friends, and who hailed him
now as a brother officer (as for old Middleton he
almost wept for joy, and swore to wet the new
commission deeply), most grateful indeed to his
heart were the humble but earnest felicitations of
the soldiers, who crowded round him, poor
fellows, all haggard, ragged, and starving though
they were, begging leave to shake his hand, and
to wish him all success and prosperity to the
end of his days.  And Quentin felt that such
genuine and heartfelt wishes as theirs were
well worth remembering as an incentive for the
future.
</p>

<p>
But little time was there for joy or loitering
now, as the French were coming on and were
again close at hand.
</p>

<p>
Relieved from the out-picquet on the Nogales
road just as the winter dusk was deepening, he
passed through the gloomy streets of Lugo, where
ammunition waggons, unclaimed or abandoned
baggage, and dead horses weltering in pools of
dark blood, added greatly to the confusion of
those crowded, ancient, narrow, and decidedly
dirty thoroughfares; which were destitute alike
of lamps, pavement, and police, and were full of
holes, puddles, mud, and mire.  There were
sentinels, with bayonets fixed, at the doors of all the
wine-shops and bodegas; yet crowds of famished
soldiers loitered about them, while the dreaded
provost-marshal guard, with cord and triangles,
and patrols of horse and foot passed slowly to
and fro in every direction, to enforce that order
which the alcalde and his alguazils considered
hopeless.
</p>

<p>
Quentin soon found, however, where the colonel
and colours of the Borderers were lodged.  It
was an old mansion which had once belonged to
the Knights of Santiago, the highest order of
chivalry in Spain; and above its arched door,
where two of the colonel's servants were chatting
and smoking&mdash;one leisurely polishing a pair of
hessian boots, and the other oiling the harness of
his charger&mdash;he saw carved on a large marble
block the badge of the order: a sword <i>gules</i>, the
hilt powdered with fleurs-de-lis, and the stern
motto, <i>Sanguine Arabum</i>.
</p>

<p>
It happened, though seated over his wine, after
such a dinner as the exigencies of the time enabled
him to procure, and though in company with his
old friend the gallant and fashionable Lord Paget,
then in his fortieth year, rehearsing together their
gay but somewhat coarse memories and experiences
of Carlton House and the Pavilion, the
Honourable Cosmo was far from being in the
best of humours.
</p>

<p>
A full conviction of the sudden and disastrous
turn in the prospects of the expedition&mdash;the army
was now only fighting to escape home&mdash;together
with the knowledge that on landing in England a
horde of harpies&mdash;Jews, lawyers, and tipstaves,
were all ready to pounce upon him, with protested
bills, accounts, I.O.U.'s, post-obits, bonds, and
Heaven only knows what more, the result of
his Guards' life and reckless expenditure in
London&mdash;all this, we say, well nigh drove him frantic;
and Paget's memories of their brilliant past, and
their wild, disreputable orgies with the Prince of
Wales and his set, added stings to the terror
with which he viewed the future.
</p>

<p>
Flora's fair acres might have stood in the gap
between him and ruin, but fate and Quentin
Kennedy ordained it should be otherwise.
</p>

<p>
"Egad, Paget, you see how it is; I've drained
the paternal pump dry&mdash;there are bounds to
patience, and his lordship will not advance me
another guinea beyond my allowance.  Indeed, I
could scarcely expect it; and thus, I dare not land
in England!"
</p>

<p>
"Let us be afloat before we talk of landing,"
replied Paget; "it will be a deuced bad affair for
us all if we don't find our transports in Vigo Bay;
and, <i>entre nous</i>, I think Moore has some doubts
about them."
</p>

<p>
"I don't care a straw if undistinguishable
ruin should fall upon us all!"
</p>

<p>
"Which is certain to be the case, if the said
transports are not there," replied the other, with
a yawn.  "But come, Crawford, fill your glass
again; is this champagne some of the stuff we
found in Colbert's baggage?"
</p>

<p>
"My fate will soon be decided," said the other,
pursuing his own thoughts; "to-morrow, perhaps,
for I can see some indication of taking up
a position here, in front of Lugo."
</p>

<p>
"Yes; but the infernal miners failed at the
bridges of the Minho, and the Sil&mdash;the river of gold."
</p>

<p>
"Thus, I say," continued Cosmo, doggedly,
"Paget, old fellow, my fate will soon be decided!"
</p>

<p>
"And it is&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Death on a Spanish battle-field, or to rot in
an English prison!"
</p>

<p>
"Don't talk so bitterly; once in London again,
we shall see what can be done.  Another glass
of this sparkling liquid!&mdash;wine, wine, I
say&mdash;drown the blue devils in a red sea of it!"
exclaimed the gay Paget.
</p>

<p>
"Something stronger than wine for me now,"
said Cosmo, as he filled a large glass nearly full
with undiluted brandy, and drained it; "life is
short, and not very merry here."
</p>

<p>
"Egad!  I know no place, however, where it
is so difficult to live and so easy to die."
</p>

<p>
"Right&mdash;so easy to die!" added Cosmo, with
a strange and sickly smile.
</p>

<p>
It was at this inauspicious moment that a
servant in uniform&mdash;liveries there were none then
with the army&mdash;brought in Quentin's name.
</p>

<p>
"What the devil can this fellow possibly want
with me?" said Cosmo, full of surprise at a
circumstance so unusual as a visit from Quentin;
"is he below?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir."
</p>

<p>
"What does he wish?"
</p>

<p>
"To see you, sir," replied the soldier, with a
second salute.
</p>

<p>
"Who is it?" drawled Paget, watching his cigar-smoke
curling upward, and depositing the leg he
was destined to leave at Waterloo on a spare chair.
</p>

<p>
"That fellow who was tried by a court-martial
at Alva de Tormes."
</p>

<p>
"Tried&mdash;ah, I remember, for everything but
high treason and housebreaking, eh?&mdash;ha! ha!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes; but who gave the charges the go-by at
racing speed.  Send him up!"
</p>

<p>
Quentin entered with a flush on his cheek and
a painful beating in his heart.  He bowed low
to General Paget, whom he knew by sight, and
to Cosmo, who responded by a quiet stare, and
who, before he was addressed, said sharply&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"I generally have my eye on you, sir, and
I thought that you were with the outlying
picquets in front of the town?"
</p>

<p>
"I was, Colonel Crawford; but&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"<i>Was</i>&mdash;and how does it come to pass that you are
relieved, or here at this time?" asked Cosmo, loftily.
</p>

<p>
"Because, sir, I am now Lieutenant Kennedy,
of the 7th Fusiliers, serving on the personal staff
of Sir John Moore."
</p>

<p>
On hearing this Paget raised his eyebrows and
smiled; but Cosmo hastily thrust his gold glass
into his right eye, and glared at Quentin through
it as he wheeled his chair half round, and
surveyed him with cool insolence from head to foot.
</p>

<p>
"Are you mad, fellow?" he asked, quietly
but earnestly.
</p>

<p>
"Less so than you, Colonel Crawford," replied
Quentin, with suppressed passion; "I have here
to show you a note from the general."
</p>

<p>
"To show <i>me</i>?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir; because it goes from you direct to
the adjutant-general for insertion in orders."
</p>

<p>
Cosmo coughed, and very leisurely opened the
little note which Quentin handed to him.
</p>

<p>
"So, sir," said he, "so far as this scrap of
paper imports&mdash;and I know Moore's writing
well&mdash;he has appointed you an extra aide-de-camp?"
</p>

<p>
"He has done me the honour, Colonel Crawford."
</p>

<p>
"Your health, sir," said Lord Paget, frankly;
"I congratulate you&mdash;won't you drink?"
</p>

<p>
"You might more usefully fill up the time
necessary to qualify you for a staff appointment
by serving with some corps of the army."
</p>

<p>
"The 25th, perhaps?" said Quentin, whose
temper Cosmo's cutting coldness was rapidly
bringing to a white heat.
</p>

<p>
"No, sir," he replied, with one of his insolent
smiles, "I did not mean our friends the Borderers."
</p>

<p>
"What corps, then?"
</p>

<p>
"The Belem Rangers; what do you think
of them?"
</p>

<p>
"Crawford!" exclaimed Lord Paget, starting
with astonishment, for this imaginary corps was
our general Peninsular term for all skulkers,
malingerers, and others who showed the white
feather, by loitering in the great hospital of
Belem, near Lisbon.
</p>

<p>
Quentin felt all that the studied insult
implied; the blood rushed back upon his aching
heart, and he grew very pale.  The conviction
now that his position was <i>different</i>, that Cosmo
wished by deliberate insolence to provoke and
destroy him, rushed upon his mind, and gave him
coolness and reflection, so he said, quietly&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"I shall not report your kind suggestion to Sir
John Moore; but I presume I may now withdraw?"
</p>

<p>
"Sir," resumed Cosmo, starting from his chair
pale with passion, as he seemed now to have a
legitimate and helpless object on which to wreak
his bitterness of soul&mdash;a bitterness all the deeper
that it was now inflamed by wine&mdash;"sir, I refer
to General Lord Paget if your bearing has not
something of a mutinous sneer in it?"
</p>

<p>
"My smile might, Colonel Crawford; but not
bearing, be assured of that."
</p>

<p>
"Sir, what the devil do you mean?  Is it to
bandy words with me?  You hear him, Paget?"
said Cosmo, incoherently, and purple alike with
fury and a sense of shame at the exhibition he
was making; "you hear him?"
</p>

<p>
"I have no intention of insulting you," urged
Quentin, anxious only to begone.
</p>

<p>
"Insults are never suspected by me, but when
I know they are intended, as I feel they are
now.  Even your presence here is an insult!  Now,
sir, do you understand me, and your resource&mdash;your
resource&mdash;do you understand <i>that</i>&mdash;eh?"
</p>

<p>
"For God's sake, Crawford! are you mad?"
interposed Lord Paget; "what the devil is up
between you?"
</p>

<p>
"More than I can tell you, Paget."
</p>

<p>
"With this mere lad, and you a man of the
world!"
</p>

<p>
"'Sblood!  Yes, with him."
</p>

<p>
The Master's mad pride had involved him in
many quarrels, and he had paraded more than
one man at the back of Montague House, in
London, in the Duke's Walk at Holyrood, and
elsewhere&mdash;luckless fellows who had resented his
overbearing disposition&mdash;so a duel to him was nothing,
and in his baffled pique and ungovernable fury he
was now wicked enough to aim at one.
</p>

<p>
"Cosmo Crawford," exclaimed Quentin, his
dark eyes flashing through the moisture that
filled them, "Master of Rohallion," he added
in a choking voice, "I have too often, as a child,
slept on your good old mother's breast to level a
pistol at yours, else, sir&mdash;else&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Bah!" shouted Cosmo, turning on his heel;
"I thought so.  Belem for ever!"
</p>

<p>
"To-morrow we may be engaged with the
enemy," said Quentin, in the same broken voice;
"I shall be in the field, and mounted too; then
let us see whether you or I ride closest to the
bayonets of the French!"
</p>

<p>
"Agreed&mdash;agreed!" said Cosmo, with stern
energy, as his pale eyes, that shrunk and dilated,
filled with more than usual of their old baleful
gleam, and he wrung with savage energy the
proffered hand of Quentin, who hastened away.
</p>

<p>
"By Jove," said Paget, laughing, as he filled
his glass with champagne, "this same beats
cock-fighting!  But what the devil is it all about?"
</p>

CHAPTER XVII.
<br /><br />
THE COMBAT OF LUGO.
</h3>

<p class="intropoem">
  "New clamours and new clangours now arise,<br />

  Resolved on death, resolved to die in arms.<br />

</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"Whatever may be their misery," says General
Napier, "soldiers will always be found clean at
a review and ready at a fight."  The order to
take up a position and form line of battle in
front of Lugo had scarcely been issued, when
a change came over the bearing, aspect, and
emotions of the men.  Pale, weary, and exhausted
though they were, vigour and discipline
were restored to the ranks, with confidence and
valour!
</p>

<p>
The stragglers came hurrying in to rejoin the
regiments, that they might share in the battle
which was to give them vengeance for the past,
or, it might be, a last relief for the future.  Three
fresh battalions, left by Sir David Baird in his
advance to Astorga, had joined Sir John Moore
in rear of Villa Franca, and thus, at Lugo, he
found himself at the head of nineteen thousand
hardy and well-tried men.
</p>

<p>
Moore's generous kindness to Quentin on this
occasion served completely to obliterate the affair
of the preceding evening.  He soon procured him
a horse, and pleased with the modest bearing, the
grateful and earnest desire to serve and deserve,
with the enthusiasm of the young subaltern, he
presented him with the sword of General Colbert,
a French officer, (said to be of Scottish descent,)
who had been shot by a rifleman of the 95th at
Cazabelos, on the 3rd of January.
</p>

<p>
"Take this sabre," said he, "and preserve it
alike as the present of a friend and the weapon
of one of France's bravest soldiers.  The hilt is
plain enough; and as for the blade, let the enemy
be the best judges of <i>that</i>.  Follow me now to
the lines."
</p>

<p>
That sabre Quentin resolved to treasure, even
as he treasured the ring of Flora Warrender.
</p>

<p>
Grey day was breaking now, and at that dread
time when the troops were forming, and the
morning gun pealed from the old walls of Lugo&mdash;the
early hour of a chill winter morning&mdash;he
knew that she who loved him so well, all
unconscious of his danger, the beloved of his heart,
was lying calmly in her bed at home, asleep,
perhaps with a smile upon her lips, while he was
here, far away, face to face and front to front
with Death!
</p>

<p>
He rode forth with Stanhope, Burrard, Hardinge,
Grahame of Lynedoch (the future hero of
Barossa), and others of Moore's brilliant staff,
his young heart beating high with pride and joy,
as well it might with such companions and on
such an auspicious day.
</p>

<p>
"On this ground, gentlemen, unless the enemy
advance in great strength," said Moore, "I shall
only be too happy to meet them."
</p>

<p>
As Quentin passed the 25th moving into
position in close column of subdivisions, many
a hand grasped his in hearty greeting, and many
a cap was waved, for the eyes of the whole corps
were on him.
</p>

<p>
"'Tis well," said Moore; "I like that spirit
much!  They seem proud of you, Kennedy, as
one of their corps.  Pass the orders, gentlemen,
to the generals of division and brigade to prepare
for action."
</p>

<p>
The staff separated at a gallop.
</p>

<p>
"Off with the hammer-stalls," was now the
command; "uncase colours&mdash;examine flints,
priming, and ammunition."
</p>

<p>
About mid-day, after standing for some hours
under arms with their colours flying and exposed
to a keen and biting wind, the British saw the
dark masses of the French appear.  There was
no sun shining; thus no burnished steel flashed
from amid their sombre ranks, which numbered
seventeen thousand infantry and four thousand
horse, with fifty guns; and now, all soaked with
a drenching rain overnight, they were deploying
into line, while many other columns were pouring
forward in their rear.
</p>

<p>
Moore's right, chiefly composed of the Guards,
was posted on flat and open ground, flanked by
a bend of the Minho.  His centre was among
vineyards and low stone walls.  His left was
somewhat thrown back, resting on the mountains
and supported by cavalry.
</p>

<p>
It was his intention to engage deeply with his
right and centre and bear the enemy on, before
he closed up with the left wing, in which he
placed the flower of his troops, including the
Highland Regiments, hoping thus to bring on a
decisive battle, and have the French so handled
by the bayonet that he might continue the
remainder of the retreat unmolested.
</p>

<p>
Further hope than this, alas! he had none.
</p>

<p>
As the French deployed along the mountain
ridge in front of Lugo, they could not see
distinctly either the strength or position of the
British; so Soult advanced with four field guns
and some squadrons of horse under Colonel
Lallemand, to feel the way and throw a few shot
at the vineyard walls on speculation.
</p>

<p>
"Bah!  M. le MarÃ©chal," said Colonel Lallemand,
confidently; "they are all fled, those pestilent
English, or 'tis only a rear-guard we have here."
</p>

<p>
"I suspect, M. le Colonel, you will find something
more than a rear-guard," replied Soult, as
fifteen white puffs of smoke rose up from the low
walls in front, and a dozen or so round cannon-shot
came crashing among their gun-carriages,
dismounting two twelve-pounders and smashing
the wheel of a third.
</p>

<p>
On this Soult drew back his squadrons and
made a feint on the right, while sending a strong
column and five guns against the left, where these
fresh regiments were posted.
</p>

<p>
Coming on with wild halloos, and not a few of
them chanting the "Carmagnole," the French
drove in the line of skirmishers, when Moore,
followed now only by Quentin Kennedy, all the
rest of his staff being elsewhere, came galloping
along and called upon the left to "advance."
</p>

<p>
They were now fairly under fire and fast
closing up.  How different from such work in the
present day!  Now we may open a destructive
fusillade at a thousand yards rifle-range, and so
fire on for hours; then, after coming within range
with Brown Bess, scarcely three rounds would be
fired, before British and foreign pluck were tested
by the bayonet.
</p>

<p>
Perceiving that the skirmishers of the
Borderers were also falling back before a peppery
cloud of little voltigeurs in light green.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Kennedy," said Moore, "ride to the
Honourable Colonel Crawford&mdash;tell him to advance at
once in line; I will lead on the regiments here."
</p>

<p>
Quentin, who was tolerably well mounted,
dashed up to where Cosmo, cold and stern as
ever, sat on his horse at the head of the regiment.
</p>

<p>
"Colonel Crawford," said he, with a profound
salute, "it is Sir John Moore's order that you
advance with the bayonet&mdash;the whole left wing is
to be thrown forward."
</p>

<p>
Cosmo's eyes flashed and dilated with anger at
having to take an order from Quentin; he frowned
and lingered.
</p>

<p>
"Did you hear me, Colonel Crawford&mdash;that
your battalion is to charge?"
</p>

<p>
"Orders, and from <i>you</i>?" said Cosmo, grinding
his teeth.
</p>

<p>
"From Sir John Moore," urged Quentin,
breathlessly.
</p>

<p>
Now there is at times a wild impulse which
seizes the heart of man and will make him set, it
may be, the fate of all his future&mdash;it may be life
itself, upon the issue of a single chance; and such
a daring impulse now fired the soul of Quentin.
</p>

<p>
"Twenty-fifth," he exclaimed, brandishing his
sabre, "you are to advance&mdash;prepare to charge."
</p>

<p>
"Dare you give orders here?" cried Cosmo,
hoarse with passion, and scarcely knowing what
he said; "I follow none&mdash;let all who dare follow
me.  Rohallion leads, but follows none."
</p>

<p>
"Come on then <i>together</i>."
</p>

<p>
"Forward&mdash;double quick&mdash;charge!" they
cried together with their horses neck and neck
rushing onward, while the battalion, with a loud
hurrah, fell upon the enemy, bayoneting the
skirmishers and closing on the main body.
</p>

<p>
"Bravo, Kennedy!" cried old Middleton, waving
his rusty sabre; "I wish Dick Warriston was
here to see you to-day.  It's a proud man he'd
be, for dearly he loved you, lad.  Whoop! here we
are right on the top of the vagabonds," he added,
as the front rank of a sallow-visaged, grimly-bearded,
grey-coated French column broke in disorder
and gave way before the furious advance of
the Borderers, whose two field officers were at that
moment unhorsed.
</p>

<p>
Middleton's charger received a ball in its
counter and he had a narrow escape from another,
which buried itself in a great old silver
hunting-watch which he wore in his fob, and was known
as the "regimental clock."  Quentin perceived
him scrambling up, however, unhurt, just as he
had hurried to the assistance of Cosmo, who, some
twenty yards in front of the corps, had been
knocked from his saddle in the mÃªlÃ©e by two
Frenchmen, who had their muskets withdrawn,
bayonets fixed, and butts upwards, to pin him to
the earth on which he lay helpless.
</p>

<p>
Dashing spurs into his horse, Quentin rushed
upon one, and rode him right down, at the same
moment burying his sabre in the body of the
other.  The first voltigeur was only stunned;
but the second fell, wallowing in blood.
</p>

<p>
Quentin dragged Cosmo up, and assisted him
to remount.
</p>

<p>
"I thank Heaven, sir," said he; "I was just in
time to save your life."
</p>

<p>
"From any other hands than yours it had been
welcome," said he, haughtily; "however, I thank
you.  Sound, bugler, to halt, and re-form on the
colours!"
</p>

<p>
As Quentin rode away, the proud consciousness
in his heart, that he had returned great good for
great evil, gave place to another.  He saw the
second Frenchman rolling in blood on the ground,
and clutching the grass in his agony.  Then a
sensation of deadly sickness came over his destroyer's
heart&mdash;a sensation that he could neither analyse
nor describe.  So he spurred madly toward the
extreme left, where Sir John Moore by accident
found himself in front of his old regiment, the
51st, in which he had served as ensign.
</p>

<p>
With a voice and face alike expressive of
animation, he waved his cocked-hat and called upon
them as his old comrades to advance to the
charge.  At that moment the light company of
the 76th set the example, and the whole left wing
rushed furiously on the French with the bayonet.
There was a dreadful yell and shock; scores
of men tumbled over each other, many never to
rise again; the butt-end was freely used, and
in a minute or less, the French attack was routed,
leaving four hundred dead, dotting all the slope.
In the front rank of the 51st, Brigade-Major
David Roberts engaged a French officer hand to
hand and slew him; but the major's sword-arm
was shattered by two bullets fired by two French
soldiers, who were instantly bayoneted by an
Irishman of the 51st, named Connor.  He killed
a few more, while his hand was in, for which he
was promoted on the spot.
</p>

<p>
After this Soult made no further attack, and
thus it became apparent to Moore, that the wary
and skilful old veteran was only waiting until
Laborde's division, which was in the rear, should
come up, together with a portion of the sixth corps,
which was marching by the way of Val des Orres.
</p>

<p>
All the next day the two armies remained
embattled in sight of each other, almost without
firing a shot&mdash;Soult waiting and Moore watching&mdash;the
foe coming on hourly in fresh force, till
"the darkness fell, and with it the English
general's hope to engage his enemy on equal terms."
</p>

<p>
Quentin spent the evening of that anxious day
in the bivouac of his old friends the Borderers,
who were sharing as usual the contents of their
havresacks and canteens, and congratulating each
other on escapes, for save a few contusions none
had been hit, and none were absent save Monkton,
who was stationed with a picquet of twenty men
at the bend of the Minho.  Before and after an
action, there is an effect that remains for a time
on the minds and manner of both officers and
men.  The former show more kindness and
suavity to the latter, and generally the latter to
each other.  There is more kindness, less silly
banter, more quietness and seriousness, and the
oath is seldom heard, even on the tongue of a
fool.  It may be, that all have felt eternity nearer
them than usual, and yet in time of war, the
soldier is face to face with it daily.
</p>

<p>
Large fires were lighted all along the British
line, and in their glare, the piles of arms were
seen to flash and glitter, while for warmth, the
weary soldiers lay beside them in close ranks
on the damp earth.
</p>

<p>
"A plucky thing that was of yours to-day,
Kennedy," said Middleton, "sabreing the voltigeur
and remounting the colonel.  You left <i>me</i>,
your old friend, to shift for myself, however."
</p>

<p>
"I saw you were in no danger, major," said
Quentin, with some confusion; "and being
independent now of Crawford, I wished&mdash;I
wished&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"To heap ashes on his head; I fear I am not
generous enough to have acted as you did, and
marred a step in the regiment."
</p>

<p>
"A shot grazed my cap <i>here</i>," said a captain
named Drummond; "another inch, and there had
been a company vacant."
</p>

<p>
"I wonder what the devil Moore is loitering
here for?" asked some one.
</p>

<p>
"Kennedy's on the staff now; he ought to
know the secrets of the bureau," said Colville.
</p>

<p>
"Has anything oozed out, Quentin?" asked
Askerne.
</p>

<p>
"He can tell us that we'll attack the French
position about daybreak, before Loison, Laborde,
or Ney can join," said Colyear, laughing.
</p>

<p>
"Ney is at Villa Franca," added Captain
Winton, a grave and thoughtful officer (who fought
a duel at Merida).  "I suspect Moore remains
here, in expectation of being attacked <i>before</i> these
reinforcements come up."
</p>

<p>
"Now would be the time to fall back in the
night towards Vigo, and take up a position to
cover the embarkation," said Askerne.
</p>

<p>
"Right, Rowland," responded Quentin; "we
are only able to fight one battle, and desperation
will make us do so well.  And it is not meant
that after winning a battle we should enter Castile
again with a handful of jaded men, and not an ally
to aid us between Corunna and the ridges of the
Sierra Morena.  I heard Moore himself say this."
</p>

<p>
"Who comes here?" they heard a sentinel
challenge at a distance.
</p>

<p>
"What comes here would be more grammatical,
my friend," replied a dolorous voice which they
knew, as four soldiers appeared, half supporting
and half carrying an officer.
</p>

<p>
"What is all that?" asked Middleton.
</p>

<p>
"The mangled remains of William Monkton,
esquire, lieutenant, 25th Foot," replied that
personage, as the soldiers laid him on the turf
near the watchfire.
</p>

<p>
"What is the matter, Willie? are you wounded?"
asked Askerne, putting a canteen of grog to the
sufferer's mouth.
</p>

<p>
"I should think so!  a devil of a runaway
horse from the enemy's lines came smash over
me.  I say, Doctor Salts-and-senna," he added
to the assistant surgeon, who had joined the
group; "I am not past your skill, I hope?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, Monkton, you haven't even a bone
broken," said the doctor, half angrily, as he rapidly
felt him all over; "you are sadly bruised, though,
and will have to ride, if we continue the retreat."
</p>

<p>
At that moment Hardinge galloped up to
Cosmo, who was sitting on a fallen tree, cloaked
and alone, near his horse, for his officers seldom
cared to join him, or he to join them.
</p>

<p>
"Colonel Crawford," said he, hurriedly, but
loud enough to be heard by all, "the whole line
is to fall instantly back towards Corunna by a
forced night march.  All the fires are to be kept
brightly burning to deceive the enemy, and all
movements will be made left about, to prevent
the clashing of the pouches being heard.  Move
in silence, as we must completely mask our
retreat.  Mr. Kennedy, you will be so good as
take these orders without delay along the line,
and desire the 51st, the 76th, and the cavalry of
the left flank, to fall back and be off, without
sound of bugle.  Thirty-five miles in our rear,
the bridge of Betanzos is being undermined; that
point once passed, and the bridge blown up, we
shall be safe!"
</p>

<p>
It was indeed time to fall back.  Soult's first
reinforcements had come up in overwhelming
force, and in the stores of Lugo there was not
bread for <i>one</i> more day's subsistence.  The troops
were exhorted by Moore to keep order and "to
make a great exertion, which he trusted would
be the <i>last</i> required of them."
</p>

<p>
At ten o'clock the march began.
</p>

<p>
In rear of the position the country was
encumbered by intricate lanes and stone walls;
but officers who had examined all the avenues
were selected to guide the columns, and just as a
dreadful storm of wind and rain, mixed with icy
sleet, burst forth upon that devoted army, the
rearward march began, and when the dull January
morning stole slowly in, save a few wretched,
barefooted, and worn-out stragglers, nothing
remained of the British position in front of Lugo
but the drenched and soddened dead bodies of
those who had fallen in the conflict, and the
smouldering ashes of the long line of watch-fires,
that extended from the mountains towards the
bend of the Minho.

A WARNING.

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Soft; I did but dream.<br />
  O, coward conscience, how dost thou afflict me!<br />
  The lights burn blue.  It is now dead midnight,<br />
  Cold fearful drops stand on my trembling flesh.<br />
  What do I fear?  Myself? there's none else by."<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Richard III.</i><br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Sir John Moore and General Paget, with the
cavalry, covered the retreat; the former ordered
several small bridges to be destroyed to check
the enemy's advance; but such was the
inefficiency of the engineer force, that in every
instance the mines <i>failed</i>.  The rain, the wind,
and the sleet continued; more soldiers perished
by the way, and more stragglers were taken or
sabred by the enemy's light horse; then again
demoralization and despair pervaded the ranks.
So numerous did the stragglers of all corps
become, that more than once they found themselves
strong enough to face about and check the
cavalry of Lallemand and Ribeaupierre.  The
Guards, Artillery, and Highlanders alone
preserved their discipline.
</p>

<p>
So great was the fatigue endured by the troops,
that, on the evening of the 10th, when the 3rd
battalion of the Royal Scots entered Betanzos,
it mustered, under the colours, nine officers, three
sergeants, and <i>three</i> privates; "all the rest had
dropped on the roads, and many did not rejoin
for three days."
</p>

<p>
At this place, which is a village at the foot of
a hill, where the Mandeo was crossed by a
wooden bridge, on which the engineers were hard
at work, they were attacked by Ribeaupierre's
dragoons, who, however, were repulsed by the
23th Regiment; the bridge was destroyed, and its
beams and planks hurled into the swollen stream,
which swept them away to the Gulf of Ferrol.
</p>

<p>
And here a party of straggling invalids,
exhausted by fatigue, were closely pressed by the
French cavalry; a Sergeant Newman, of the 2nd
battalion of the 43rd, who was himself nearly
worn out, rallied them with his pike, and gradually
collected four hundred men of all regiments.
With great presence of mind, he formed those
poor fellows into subdivisions, and made them
fire and retire by sections, each re-forming in rear
of the others, so that he most effectually covered
the retreat of the disabled men who covered all
that fearful road&mdash;conduct so spirited that he
was publicly thanked by Generals Fraser and Fane.
</p>

<p>
The destruction of the bridge more decidedly
secured the retreat; but more men perished
between Betanzos and Lugo than anywhere else,
since that rearward march began.  Moore, by his
energy, massed the army, now reduced to fourteen
thousand infantry, which, on the morning of
the llth January, fell back on Corunna, under
his immediate and personal superintendence.
</p>

<p>
"Stanhope," said he to his favourite aide-de-camp,
who was almost ever by his side, "we are
now within a few miles of Corunna; ride forward
with me, as I am all anxiety to see if our
fleet is in the bay&mdash;Kennedy will accompany us."
</p>

<p>
Quentin bowed, put spurs to his horse, and
quitting Paget's cavalry rearguard together, they
rode rapidly along the line of march to the front.
</p>

<p>
They soon reached the heights of Corunna,
and saw the town beneath them about four miles
distant; then a sad expression stole over Moore's
handsome face, but no exclamation escaped him.
</p>

<p>
Not a ship was visible in the Bays of Orsan
or Betanzos, nor in the harbour of the town;
the Roads of Ferrol and all the expanse of water
were open and empty!
</p>

<p>
Fortune was against him and his army, for
contrary winds detained the fleet of men-of-war
and transports at Vigo, a hundred and twenty
miles distant by sea.
</p>

<p>
The morning was sunny, and Corunna on its
fortified peninsula&mdash;the <i>Corun</i>, or "tongue of
land" of the Celts&mdash;was seen distinctly, with all
its strong bastions and gothic spires; its almost
land-locked harbour, guarded by the castles of
San Martino and Santa Cruz, with the flag of
King Ferdinand VII. flying on the fort of San
Antonio (which crowns a high and insular rock),
and on the Pharos of Hercules.
</p>

<p>
For Sir John Moore there was nothing left
now but to prepare to defend the position in front
of the town till the fleet should come round.
He quartered his army in Corunna and its
suburbs; the reserve he posted at El Burgo, on
the river Mero, the bridge of which he destroyed.
</p>

<p>
He also sent an engineer officer with a party
of sappers to blow up the bridge of Cambria.
Some delay took place in the ignition of the
mine, and he despatched Quentin Kennedy to
the officer with an angry expostulation.
</p>

<p>
Mortified by repeated failures elsewhere during
the retreat, the officer was anxious to perform
this duty effectually.  He approached the mine
to examine it, and at that moment it exploded!
</p>

<p>
Quentin felt the earth shake beneath his feet;
the arch of the bridge sprung upward like a huge
lid; a column of dark earth, stones, and dust,
spouted into the air to descend in ruins,
bringing with them the mutilated fragments of the
poor engineer officer, who was literally blown
to pieces; but this was a mere squib when
compared with the explosion of two magazines
containing four thousand casks of powder, which
were blown up on the 13th, to prevent them
from falling into the hands of the enemy.  On
this occasion, says an eye-witness, "there ensued
a crash like the bursting forth of a volcano; the
earth trembled for miles, the rocks were torn
from their bases, and the agitated waters rolled the
vessels as in a storm; a vast column of smoke and
dust, shooting out fiery sparks from its sides, arose
perpendicularly and slowly to a great height, and
then a shower of stones and fragments of all
kinds bursting out of it with a roaring sound,
killed several persons who remained too near the
spot.  A stillness, only interrupted by the lashing
of the waves on the shore, succeeded, and the
business of the war went on."
</p>

<p>
All this powder had been sent from England
and left there, by the red-tapists of the time, to
be destroyed thus, while more than once the armies
of Britain and Spain had been before the enemy
with their pouches empty!
</p>

<p>
In Corunna, the jaded British had now breathing
time, but the exulting French were still pouring
on.  Some of Moore's staff suggested that he
should send a flag of truce to Soult and negotiate
for permission to embark unmolested&mdash;a suggestion
which his undaunted heart rejected with scorn
and anger.
</p>

<p>
"I rely on my own powers," said he, "for
defying the enemy, and extricating with honour
my troops from their perilous position."
</p>

<p>
Food, shelter, and rest restored vigour, and
force of habit brought discipline back to the ranks;
fresh ammunition was served out, and in many
instances the men were supplied with new firelocks
in lieu of those rusted and worn by the weather
during the retreat; but hearty were the cheers
that rung in Corunna when, on the evening of
the 14th, the fleet of transports from Vigo were
seen bearing slowly into the harbour, under full
sail, and coming each in succession to anchor.
At the same time, however, an orderly, sent by
Sir David Baird, came spurring in hot haste to
announce that the French had repaired the bridge
of El Burgo, and that their cavalry and artillery
were crossing the Mero, a few miles from Corunna.
</p>

<p>
With the rest of the staff, Quentin passed all
that night in his saddle, riding between the town
and beach with orders and instructions, for, under
cover of the friendly darkness, the whole of the
women and children, sick and wounded, dismounted
dragoons, all the best horses&mdash;the useless were
shot on the beach&mdash;and fifty-two pieces of cannon
were embarked; eleven six-pounders and one
field howitzer being only retained for immediate
service.
</p>

<p>
"Hardinge," said Moore, as his staff rode into
the upper town, "you will ride over to Sir David
Baird; you, Major Colborne, to Lord Paget;
and you, Kennedy, to General Leith, to say, that
at daybreak, <i>if the French do not move</i>, they are
to fall back with their corps for instant embarkation."
</p>

<p>
And with these welcome orders, the three
aides-de-camp separated at full speed.
</p>

<p>
On this night of anxiety and bustle, the Master
of Rohallion remained idly in his billet, a pretty
villa, the windows of which faced the little bay
of Orsan, with the suburb of the Pescadera
extending from its garden on the west towards the
mainland.
</p>

<p>
Paget and some other friends of his, after
seeing their sound horses embarked and the
useless shot, had supped with him.  No one expected
any engagement to take place now; they made
light of past sorrows, spoke laughingly of the
amusements that awaited them at home, and
drank deeply.
</p>

<p>
Any momentary emotion of gratitude felt by
Cosmo for the noble manner in which young
Kennedy saved his life at Lugo was completely
forgotten now, all the recollection of that event
being completely merged in a whirlwind of rage
at the aide-de-camp for having taunted him to
the charge, and for actually daring to lead on the
battalion in the face of so many superior officers!
</p>

<p>
Cosmo had never wearied of descanting on
this military enormity, and all night long, as he
became inflamed by what he imbibed, he consulted
with Paget, Burrard, and others, as to
whether he should call Kennedy out or bring him
before a court-martial again.
</p>

<p>
The former mode of proceeding at Alva having
failed "to smash him," they were averse to
another, and all were of opinion that for the
latter course Cosmo had allowed too many days
to elapse.
</p>

<p>
"Trouble your head no more about it," said
Paget, while playing with the tassels of his gold
sash; "we'll laugh the affair over at Brighton in
a few days or so.  Soothe your mind, meantime,
by the study of these classic frescoes.  I wonder
who the devil decorated this villa!"
</p>

<p>
"Cupid and Psyche," said Burrard, who had
been adding a few decorations, such as beards and
tails, with a burnt cork; "Pyramus and Thisbe;
and, by Jove, the story of Leda!"
</p>

<p>
"Egad! such lively imaginations and odd
propensities those pagan fellows had!  Au revoir,
Crawford; we'll have the <i>gÃ©nÃ©rale</i> beaten for the
last time on Spanish ground to-morrow, and then
hey for the high road to Old England!" added
the gay hussar, who, before six months were past,
figured in an elopement, a duel, and damages to
the tune of twenty thousand pounds&mdash;an affair
that made more noise in the world of fashion
than even the Spanish campaign.
</p>

<p>
Cosmo was at last alone, and though he mixed
a glass of brandy with a goblet of champagne, he
felt strange and sad thoughts stealing over him.
</p>

<p>
He was hot and flushed, and his heart beat
tumultuously and anxiously, he knew not why.
He threw open the sash of one of the lofty
windows, which were divided in lattice-fashion
from the ceiling to the floor, and looked out upon
the night.
</p>

<p>
It was silent, clear, and starry, and not a sound
broke the calm stillness, save the chafing of the
waves on the rocks that bordered the bay.
</p>

<p>
The snow had melted, and the garden of the
villa being thickly planted with evergreens, looked
quite unlike a winter one.
</p>

<p>
Cosmo's brain, at least his whole nervous
system, seemed to have received a shock by that
fall from his horse at Lugo.  He was restless,
feverish, and anxious, without knowing why; for
being brave as man could be, he had no fear for
the morrow, and really cared very little whether
a battle was fought or not.
</p>

<p>
"What is this that is stealing over me&mdash;can it
be illness?" he asked of himself.
</p>

<p>
Thoughts and memories of home, his family,
and many an old and once tender association that
he had long forgotten were stealing over him now,
together with an uncontrollable sadness and
depression of mind: his father's cheerful voice, his
mother's loving face, came vividly to recollection,
with emotions of tenderness for which he could
not account&mdash;emotions which he strove to repress
as unnatural to him, and which actually provoked
him, by the strange pertinacity with which
they thrust themselves upon his fancy.
</p>

<p>
"Pshaw!" said he, "that deuced tumble in front
of the enemy has unmanned me&mdash;and that fellow,
too!  Confound him," he muttered through his
clenched teeth, "I hate him!"
</p>

<p>
At that moment the great bell of the citadel
tolled the hour of three.  He arose and stepped
out into the garden.  The last note of that deep
and full but distant bell, yet vibrated in the
stilly air; the stars were reflected in the dark
waters of the bay, and the light that shone in the
great Pharos of Hercules, three hundred feet
above it, as it revolved slowly on its ancient
tower, cast tremulous rays at regular intervals far
across the sea on one side and the inlet of Orsan
on the other.
</p>

<p>
The ocean breeze came gratefully to the flushed
brow of Cosmo, who suddenly perceived near him
a man in a strange uniform.
</p>

<p>
He stood in the centre of the garden walk at
a short distance from the open window, his figure
being clearly defined against the starry sky
beyond, and by a ray of light which shone from
the room Cosmo could perceive that his dress
was scarlet.
</p>

<p>
Supposing he was some straggler or other man
who should be in quarters, Crawford, whose step
was somewhat unsteady, walked boldly up to the
tall stranger, who remained silent and immovable.
</p>

<p>
He wore an old-fashioned flowing red coat
without a collar, but having deep cuffs, all
profusely laced; a large brigadier wig and
three-cornered hat, sleeve ruffles, and a long slender
sword, and he stood with his right hand firmly
planted on a walking cane.  His bearing was
noble and lofty; his long, pale, and handsome
features, in which Cosmo recognised a startling
likeness of <i>his own</i>, wore a deathlike hue, and his
eyes were sad and stony in expression.
</p>

<p>
Cosmo Crawford attempted to speak, but the
words failed on his lips; he felt the hair bristle
on his scalp, and a thrill of terror pass all over
him as the figure, phantom, fancy, or whatever
it was, pointed with its thin white hand to <i>the
plain before Corunna</i>, and then the whole outline
began to fade, the stars shone through it, and it
seemed to melt away into space!
</p>

<p>
An icy horror came over Cosmo, and his soul
trembled as he remembered the bugbear of his
boyhood, the story of the haunted gate at
Rohallion, and the wraith of his uncle John the
Master, who had been slain by the side of
Cornwallis in America.  He rushed back to the room
and flung himself panting on a sofa.
</p>

<p>
Then with a furious oath at his own timidity,
folly, or fancy, he issued boldly into the garden
again, but nothing was there save the laurel
bushes that bordered the lonely walk where he
had seen that wondrous and fantastic dream.
</p>

<p>
All seemed still&mdash;horribly so&mdash;all save the
beating of his heart and the rustling of the
regimental colours, which the night wind stirred, and
which, in virtue of his rank, were always lodged
in his apartment.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Was that a warning?</i>&mdash;bah!  And the cup
of wine!" he exclaimed.  "By this time
to-morrow night," he reflected, "I may have been
again in battle.  I may be safe and scatheless,
or dreadfully mutilated and beggared for life, or
by this hour&mdash;dreadful thought, I may be in
eternity!  I may have learned the secret of life
and death, of existence and extinction, and this
body may be lying stark, stripped, and bloody,
with its glazed eyes fixed on the stars of heaven!
Bah! another glass of wine, then!"
</p>

<p>
Cosmo slept but little that night, and it was
with a stern and gloomy foreboding of evil that
he saw the day dawn stealing over the dark grey
sea and the lofty citadel of Corunna.

The army was now rid of every incumbrance,
and all was prepared for the withdrawal of the
fighting men as soon as darkness should again set
in, and four o'clock in the afternoon of the 16th
was the time fixed by Moore for doing so; but
lo! at two o'clock on that anxious day a
messenger came from Sir John Hope to state that the
whole French army, then in position on the heights
above Corunna, was getting under arms&mdash;that a
general movement was taking place along the
entire line, twenty thousand strong!
</p>

<p>
"Stand to your arms&mdash;unpile, unpile!" was
the cry from right to left.
</p>

<p>
Long ere this, the whole British army had been
in position.
</p>

<p>
Sir David Baird held the right with his
division, while Sir John Hope's was formed across
the main road, with its left towards the Mero
river; but the whole of this combined line was
exposed to, and almost enfiladed by, a brigade of
French guns posted on the rocks above the little
village of Elvina.
</p>

<p>
Fraser's division remained before the gates of
Corunna to watch the coast road, and be prepared
to advance on any point.
</p>

<p>
But all the advantage, in strength of position,
of horse, foot, and artillery, was in favour of the
enemy.  The only cavalry in the field with Moore
were <i>forty</i> troopers of the 15th Hussars, under
the command of a lieutenant named Knight.
</p>

<p>
Opposed to Hope and Baird's slender line were
the heavy divisions of Delaborde, Merle, and Merniet,
while the cavalry of the French left, under De
Lahausaye, Lorge, Franceschi, Ribeaupierre, and
others, were thrown forward, almost in echelon and
in heavy columns, along the whole British right,
hemming them in between the Mero and the harbour
of Corunna, and menacing even the rear so far
as San Cristoval, a mile beyond Sir David Baird,
whom, however, Fraser and Lord Paget covered.
</p>

<p>
Joy sparkled in Moore's eyes as he rode along
the line at the head of his staff, and to Colonel
Graham of Balgowan he expressed his regret that
"the lateness of the hour and the shortness of
the evening would prevent them from profiting
by the victory which he confidently anticipated."
</p>

<p>
The afternoon was dull and sunless; grey
clouds covered all the louring sky; the sea
towards the offing looked black and stormy, and
the ramparts of Corunna, washed by the white
waves from the west, seemed hard, sombre, and
gloomy; but the British were in high spirits and
full of hope at the prospect of giving a graceful
and a glorious close to this inauspicious campaign.
</p>

<p>
Through Moore's telescope, which he lent him,
Quentin swept the French lines.  He could see
the masses of the Old Guard in their tall grenadier
caps, grey great-coats and enormous scarlet
epaulettes; then the ordinary infantry of the line,
in their short-waisted blue coatees and wide scarlet
trousers, advancing in three dense columns along
the heights towards the British position.  He
could see the guns being unlimbered and prepared
for service on the ridge of rock that covered the
flank of the infantry; and he could also see the
cavalry of the left; the cuirassiers of Lahausaye
in helmets and corslets of brass, with flowing
scarlet plumes and straight swords of great length;
the chasseurs of Lorge and Ribeaupierre, in light
green, with their horse-hair plumes all floating
like a sea of red and white; then the picturesque
column of Franceschi, in which were a corps of
Polish lancers, with all their tricoloured bannerols
fluttering; and some of the Mamelukes of the
Imperial Guard, with white turbans and crosses
of gold, all brandishing their crooked sabres and
loading the heavy air with uncouth and tumultuous
cries.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand were the cool and silent
British infantry; steady and still they stood in
their solid ranks, their arms loaded, primed, and
"ordered," the bayonets fixed and colours flying;
and no sound was heard along all their line, save
when the pipers of the Black Watch, the 92nd,
or some other Scottish regiment, played loud, in
defiance of the advancing foe, some historical or
traditionary air of the clan or tribe from whence
its name was taken or its ranks were filled.
</p>

<p>
To the 42nd, with the 4th and 50th, was
entrusted the defence of the extreme right, the
weakest point of the line, and on <i>their maintenance
of which</i> the safety and honour of the army
rested.
</p>

<p>
As Quentin passed his old battalion in Hope's
division on the road that led from Aris to Corunna,
he saluted Cosmo, but received no response.
Grim as Ajax, the Master was advancing with
his eyes fixed on the enemy and his left hand
clutching his gathered reins.  At that moment
perhaps, he thought less of the horrid dream of
yesternight&mdash;for a dream he assuredly deemed
it&mdash;than of the ruinous bonds, the crushing mortgages,
the post-obits, and secret loans at fifty and
sixty per cent., that a French bullet might that
day close, together with his own existence, and
he actually felt a species of grim satisfaction
that thereby the crew of money-lenders would
be outwitted.
</p>

<p>
"This is a day that will live in history, major,"
said Quentin, as he passed jolly old Middleton,
in rear of the corps, trotting his barrel-bellied
cob, an animal of grave and solemn deportment.
</p>

<p>
"Likely enough, lad," replied the other; "but
I've seen too many of these historical days now,
and I would sell cheaply alike my share in them,
with the chance of being honourably mentioned
by some future Hume or Smollett."
</p>

<p>
"So, Monkton, you've recovered your Lugo
mishap."
</p>

<p>
"Quite, Kennedy," replied that individual,
whom he overtook marching on the left flank of
his company; "never felt jollier in my
life&mdash;breakfasted about twelve to-day with Middleton
and Colville on mulled claret dashed with old
brandy.  So we are going to engage at last!
Well, I hope we shall polish off old Johnny Soult,
and get on board betimes&mdash;then ho, for Old England!"
</p>

<p>
"There, gentlemen, is the first gun!"
exclaimed Rowland Askerne, with his eyes full of
animation, as he pointed with his sword to a
field-piece that flashed on the rocks above
Elvina.  Then a 12-pound shot hummed harmlessly
through the air along the whole line of
Baird's division.
</p>

<p>
"Tyrol, tra la, la lira!" sang the reckless
Monkton; "this begins the game in earnest!"
</p>

<p>
"At such a time how can you be so thoughtless,
Willie?" said Askerne, with some asperity;
and now, from the great French battery on the
rocks, the shot and shell fell thick and fast upon
the British line, while, led by the Duke of
Dalmatia in person, the three solid columns of
Delaborde, Neale, and Merniet, descended with yells
to the assault, tricolours waving, swords flashing,
and eagles brandished.
</p>

<p>
A cloud of skirmishers preceded them, and
the white puffs of smoke that spirted from among
the underwood, the low dykes, hedgerows and
laurel bushes, marked where they nestled and took
quiet "pot shots" at the old 95th, and other
British sharp-shooters, who fell back in disorder,
as the light six-pounders failed to protect them
against the French heavy guns, which swept
Moore's line to the centre, with round shot, grape,
and canister.
</p>

<p>
From his master in the art of war, Sir Ralph
Abercrombie, Moore had learned that the presence
of a commander is always most useful near
that point at which the greatest struggle is likely
to occur; thus he remained near Lord Bentinck's
brigade, and close to the 42nd, on the extreme
right, and there Quentin and his staff accompanied him.
</p>

<p>
The French left carried the village of Elvina,
and dividing into two great masses, one poured on
against Baird's front, and the other assailed his
right under cover of their gun battery, while
their right assailed Hope at the pretty hamlet of
Palavia Abaxo.  And now the roar and carnage of
the battle became general all over the field; men
were falling fast on every side, "and human lives
were lavished everywhere;" Baird's left arm was
shattered by a grape-shot, and he was taken from
the front to have it amputated; Middleton was
struck about the same time, in the left side.
</p>

<p>
Lifting his cocked-hat, and bowing almost to his
holsters, while a cloud of hair-powder flew about
his head, this fine old soldier said, faintly, to the
Master of Rohallion&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"I am wounded, colonel, and have the honour
to request you will order another officer to take
command of the left."  He then ambled away on
his old nag towards Corunna.
</p>

<p>
"Close in, men&mdash;fill up the gaps," was the
incessant cry of the officers and sergeants; "close
up the rear ranks&mdash;close up!" and cheerily they
did so, those brave hearts and true.
</p>

<p>
As it was, the sparks of the flints, the burning
of priming (many of the muskets being bushed
with brass), caused many of the front rank men
to have their cheeks bleeding by splinters or
scorched by powder; but these were constant
occurrences before the days of percussion locks
and caps.
</p>

<p>
The fire of the enemy was terrible, and all who
were not wounded had narrow escapes.  Quentin
had no less than three during the first hour; a
ball struck one of his holster pipes, another tore
through his havresack, smashing his ration
biscuits, and a third perforated his shako, and had
he been an inch taller, he had been a dead man.
The first tightening of the heart relaxed&mdash;the
first wild thrill of anxiety over, and Quentin felt
as cool as the oldest veteran there.
</p>

<p>
The light field guns as they retired from
Elvina came tearing past with blood and human
hair upon their wheels and on the hoofs of their
galloping horses, showing the carnage through
which they had passed; but they were again
unlimbered and brought into action to check the
dragoons of Lorge, who menaced the right with
pistol and sabre.
</p>

<p>
Sir John, who, with eagle eye, had been
watching the movements of the enemy through the
openings in the white smoke which rolled along
the slopes and filled all the hollows, observed that
no more infantry were coming on than those
which outflanked the right of Baird's division,
now commanded by his successor.
</p>

<p>
"Kennedy," said he to Quentin, whose coolness
delighted and even amused him, "ride to
my friend Paget, and order him to wheel to
the right of the French advance, to menace
and attack their gun battery.  Stanhope,
spur on to Fraser and order him to support
Paget."
</p>

<p>
While his aides rode off with these orders, he
threw back the 4th Regiment in person, and
opened a heavy fire on the French, now pouring
along the valley on his right, while the old "Half
Hundred" and the Black Watch confronted those
who were breaking through Elvina.
</p>

<p>
"Well done, 50th&mdash;well done, my majors!" he
exclaimed to two favourite officers who led the
corps; but in the deadly struggle that ensued,
one, Major Charles Napier, was taken prisoner,
and the other, the Honourable Major Stanhope,
was mortally wounded.
</p>

<p>
Strewed with killed and wounded, the field was
now a veritable hell upon earth, all along the
lines in the valley and on the hills.
</p>

<p>
The boom of the heavy guns from the rock
pealed solemnly on the ear, and their bright red
flashes came luridly out of the dusky vapour
where the haze of a winter eve and the smoke of
battle mingled.
</p>

<p>
Then there was the shrill scream of the shells
as they soared aloft, describing fiery arcs through
the cold grey sky, seeming to streak it with light;
and there was the <i>whirr</i> or deep <i>hum</i> of the
cannon shot as they tore along the corpse-strewn
ground, or through the empty air.
</p>

<p>
After delivering his orders to Lord Paget,
Quentin turned his horse to the right and
pursued the Aris road in rear of Hope's division,
rushing at full speed over a great cork tree which
the cannon shot had cut down; but he reined up
for a moment near the flank of the Borderers.
</p>

<p>
Issuing from Palavia Abaxo, a corps of Delaborde's
came furiously on with a savage yell, their
bayonets fixed and tricolours flying defiantly,
though torn by grape and musketry.
</p>

<p>
They were grenadiers of the Imperial Guard,
and their long grey coats seemed black and
sombre amid the smoke.  Twice those men, the
heroes of Austerlitz and Marengo, wavered, though
never ceasing to pour in their fire; for the
resolute aspect of the Borderers&mdash;calm and voiceless,
but determined&mdash;seemed to arrest them, so the
human surge paused in its onward roll.
</p>

<p>
Then it was that the Master of Rohallion,
though cold-blooded, or animated chiefly by that
selfish cosmopolitanism which is so peculiar to
the Scottish aristocracy, felt something of his
father's gallant spirit swell up in his heart.
</p>

<p>
"The 50th and the Highlanders are carrying
all before them on the right," cried he, raising
himself in his stirrups and brandishing his sword,
"come on, 25th, let them see that we on the
left are brother Scotsmen, as well as British
soldiers&mdash;follow me&mdash;<i>charge</i>!"
</p>

<p>
And now, with a loud hurrah and like a living
wall, while the pipes rung shrill and high, the
regiment rushed headlong on the foe, and
plunging into the mass with the bayonet, hurled it back
in ruin and bloody disorder beyond the village.
</p>

<p>
In this charge poor Rowland Askerne fell
dead with a ball in his heart; Colville perished
under five bayonet wounds; Colyear had the staff
of the king's colour broken in his hand, and
many others fell killed and wounded; but Cosmo,
as if his life was a charmed one, yet escaped
unhurt, and re-formed the corps in splendid order
close to the village of Palavia Abaxo.
</p>

<p>
Quentin, who had only checked his horse to
witness his old comrades make this most glorious
charge, galloped on towards the right, where he
found the foe still pressing forward, and Moore,
sword in hand, at the head of the 42nd, most of
whose pouches were now empty.
</p>

<p>
"My brave Highlanders!" the general exclaimed,
"you have still your bayonets&mdash;<i>remember Egypt</i>!"
</p>

<p>
With a wild cheer, their plumes and tartans
waving amid the smoke, the Celts rushed on and
drove the French back in disorder upon Elvina.
</p>

<p>
A few minutes after this, just as Quentin
dismounted to breathe his horse, and just as Captain
(afterwards General and Viscount) Hardinge came
forward to report that the Guards were advancing
to support Bentinck's brigade, a round shot from
the enemy's battery on those fatal rocks passed
through them.
</p>

<p>
By the velocity of the ball, the mere force of
the air, Quentin was knocked down, breathless
and panting.  When he staggered up, he found
the general lying near him, and a startled group
gathering round them.
</p>

<p>
<i>The same ball</i> had mortally wounded Sir John
Moore, by shattering his left breast and shoulder.
Hurled from his saddle, he now lay on his back,
bleeding and dying!

CHAPTER XX.
<br /><br />
THE BURIAL.
</h3>

<p class="intropoem">
  "Not a drum was heard, not a funeral note,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As his corse to the ramparts we hurried,<br />
  Not a soldier discharged his farewell shot,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O'er the grave where our hero we buried.<br />
</p>

<p class="intropoem">
  "We buried him darkly at dead of night,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sods with our bayonets turning,<br />
  By the struggling moonbeams' misty light,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the lantern dimly burning."<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CHARLES WOLFE.<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Moore's first impulse was to struggle into a sitting
posture, and, while resting on his right hand,
to watch the wild conflict between the French
and Highlanders at Elvina.  Not a sigh of pain
escaped him, as he bent his keen blue eyes on the
corps engaged in front; but on seeing the black
and crimson plumes of the 42nd triumphantly
waving in the village, a smile of gratification
stole over his handsome face, and he allowed
himself to be borne to the rear by six Highlanders
and guardsmen, Quentin Kennedy and Captain
Hardinge assisting to keep him in an easy
position with the sash of the latter.
</p>

<p>
"Report to General Hope that I am wounded,"
said he, calmly, "and desire him to assume the
command."
</p>

<p>
Quentin observed that Sir John's sword had
got entangled in the wound, and that the hilt
was actually entering it.  On this, Captain
Hardinge kindly and gently attempted to unbuckle it.
</p>

<p>
"Never mind it, dear Hardinge," said the
dying hero; "I had rather it should go out of
the field with me."
</p>

<p>
Fast flowed the blood, and the torture of the
complicated wound was terrible!  His hands were
become cold and clammy, and his face grew
deadly pale in the dusky twilight.
</p>

<p>
"Colonel Graham of Balgowan, and Captain
Woodford of the Guards, are both gone for
surgeons," said Quentin, in his ear, while Captain
Hardinge now strove in vain to stop the crimson
current with his sash; "they will soon be here."
</p>

<p>
"You will recover from your injuries," said
Hardinge; "I can perceive it, Sir John, by the
expression of your eyes."
</p>

<p>
"No, Hardinge," said he, gravely; "I feel
that to be impossible!"
</p>

<p>
Several times he made the bearers turn him
round that he might behold the field of battle,
and then a sublime expression stole over his fine
face on seeing that everywhere the French were
falling back, and that his slender army, after all
its sufferings, was triumphant!
</p>

<p>
At this moment a spring waggon passed, in
which lay Colonel Wynch, of the 4th Regiment,
who was wounded.
</p>

<p>
"Who's in that blanket?" asked the colonel,
faintly.
</p>

<p>
"Sir John Moore, most severely wounded,"
replied Quentin.
</p>

<p>
On hearing this, the good colonel, though
bleeding fast, insisted on letting his general have
the waggon; but the Highlanders urged that they
would carry him easier in the blanket, "so they
proceeded with him to his quarters in Corunna,
weeping as they went."
</p>

<p>
Still the echoing musketry pealed through the
murky air, and still the death-dealing blaze
reddened the dusk of the coming evening.  Heavily
it volleyed at times in the intervals between the
cannon on the rocks, and through the mingled haze
up came the blood-red disc of the winter moon.
Great clouds of white powder smoke crept sluggishly
along the earth, and through it the flashes
of the French guns above Elvina came redly and
luridly out.
</p>

<p>
On being brought to his billet in Corunna, Sir
John Moore was laid on a pallet and examined,
and then all could see the terrible nature of his
wound.
</p>

<p>
The entire left shoulder was shattered; the
arm hung by a piece of skin; the ribs over the
heart were stripped of flesh and bruised to pieces,
and the muscles of the breast were torn in long
strips that had become interlaced by the recoil
of the fatal cannon-ball.
</p>

<p>
In the dusk of the gloomy apartment, where he
lay rapidly dying on a poor mattrass, he recognised
the face of Colonel Anderson, an old friend and
comrade of twenty years and more.  It was the
third time Anderson had seen him borne from a
field thus steeped in blood, but never before so
awfully mangled.  Moore pressed the hand of his
old friend, who was deeply moved.
</p>

<p>
"Anderson," said he, with a sad smile, "you
know I have always wished to die in this way."
</p>

<p>
Anderson answered only with his tears, yet he
was a weather-beaten soldier, who had looked
death in the face on many a hard-fought field.
</p>

<p>
"Are the French beaten?" Moore asked of all
who came in, successively, and the assurances
that they were retiring fast soothed his dying
moments.
</p>

<p>
"I hope the people of England will be
satisfied&mdash;I hope my dear country will do me
justice!" said he, with touching earnestness; "oh,
Anderson, you will see my friends at home as
soon as you can&mdash;tell them everything&mdash;my poor
mother&mdash;&mdash;"  Here his voice completely failed
him; he became deeply agitated; but after a
pause said, "Hope&mdash;Hope&mdash;I have much to say
to him, but am too weak now!  Are all my
aides-de-camp well?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," replied Anderson, who did not wish to
distress him by the information that young
Captain Burrard was mortally wounded.
</p>

<p>
"I have made my will, and&mdash;and&mdash;have
remembered all my servants.  Colbourne has it&mdash;tell
Willoughby that Colbourne is to get his
lieutenant-colonelcy.&mdash;Oh, it is a great satisfaction
to me that we have beaten the French.  Is Paget
in the room?"
</p>

<p>
"No," replied Anderson, in a low voice.
</p>

<p>
"It is General Paget, I mean; remember me
to him&mdash;he is a fine fellow!  I feel myself so
strong&mdash;ah, I fear that I shall be a long time in
dying!"
</p>

<p>
In the intervals of his faint and disjointed
remarks the boom of the distant artillery was
occasionally heard, and their fitful flashes reddened
the walls and windows of the room where he lay.
</p>

<p>
"Is that young lieutenant of the
Fusiliers&mdash;Kennedy&mdash;is, is he here?"
</p>

<p>
"I am here, sir," said Quentin, in a choking
voice.
</p>

<p>
"I cannot see you&mdash;the light of my eyes fails
me now.  I meant&mdash;I meant&mdash;for you."
</p>

<p>
What he "meant" to have done, Quentin was
fated never to know.
</p>

<p>
In broken accents the general thanked the
surgeons politely for the care they had taken;
and apologized for the trouble he gave them.  He
then said to the son of Earl Stanhope, who served
on his staff,
</p>

<p>
"Remember me&mdash;Stanhope&mdash;to&mdash;your sister."
</p>

<p>
He referred to the famous and brilliant Lady
Hester Stanhope, whom he was said to have loved,
and who died in Syria in 1839.  Here his voice
again completely failed him, and while pressing
to his breast the hand of Colonel Anderson, who
had saved his life at St. Lucia, he expired
without a struggle in his forty-eighth year......
</p>

<p>
All stood in silence around the pallet whereon
that brave gentleman and Christian soldier lay
dead, and some time elapsed before they could
realize the full extent of the calamity which had
befallen them, and with moistened eyes they
watched the pale still face, the fallen jaw, the
shattered and blood-soaked form.
</p>

<p>
Just as Colonel Anderson knelt down to close
the eyes of his dead friend and commander,
Quentin Kennedy, with a heavy sigh in his throat,
a sob in his breast, issued from the house, and
grasping the sabre of Colbert, Moore's doubly-prized
gift, he leaped on his horse, and, as if to
relieve himself from thoughts of grief and sorrow,
galloped towards the battle-field.
</p>

<p>
The night was now quite dark, and Sir John
Hope had succeeded in following out Moore's
dispositions so well, that he had driven the whole
French line so far back that the British had now
advanced far beyond their original position.
</p>

<p>
All Soult's ammunition was expended, though
his troops were still the most numerous.  He
could not advance, and neither could he retreat,
as the rain-swollen Mero was foaming along in
full flood in his rear, and the rudely re-constructed
bridge of El Burgo was his only avenue for
escape.
</p>

<p>
It was now that Hope ordered a great line of
watch-fires to be lighted by the picquets, and to
have them kept burning to deceive the enemy,
while the wounded, so far as possible, were carried
off, and the whole army embarked, covered by
Rowland Hill's brigade, which was posted in and
near the ramparts of the citadel.
</p>

<p>
The field presented a scene of unexampled
horror as Quentin rode back towards Corunna.
Worn out by the long day passed under arms, the
troops fell back, in somewhat shattered order, by
companies and regiments towards the beach, the
shadow of night concealing innumerable episodes
of suffering, of solitary and unpitied dissolution.
</p>

<p>
The British loss was estimated at eight
hundred, the French at three thousand men, so
superior were our arms and firing.
</p>

<p>
In a place where the dead lay thick there sat a
piper of the 92nd; he was wounded and bleeding
to death, yet he played to his retreating comrades
so long as strength remained, and then lay back
dead, with the mouth-piece of the chanter between
his relaxed jaws.
</p>

<p>
Everywhere in the dark Quentin heard voices
calling for water.
</p>

<p>
"Un verre de l'eau, pour l'amour de Dieu!" cried
many a poor Frenchman unheeded, as the columns
fell back in fierce exultation upon Corunna, in
many instances double quick.
</p>

<p>
Quentin rode back to the town, a three-miles'
distance, and having neither post nor duty to
repair to, went straight through the dark and
crowded streets, which were full of soldiers and
terrified citizens, to the house where he had seen
his beloved leader expire.  The door stood open;
the mansion was dark, empty, chilly, and silent, and
the body had been removed, he knew not where.
</p>

<p>
Just as he was turning away irresolute whether
to inquire for the Borderers and get into one of
the hundred boats now plying in the dark with
war-worn troops, between the mole and fleet of
transports, or whether he should join the staff of
General Hill, whose brigade still occupied the
citadel, a mounted staff-officer passed near him,
and, by the light of a torch held by a Spaniard,
who ran through the street, they recognised each
other.
</p>

<p>
"'Tis well I have met you, Kennedy&mdash;come
this way&mdash;we are about to pay the last earthly
rites to poor Sir John Moore."
</p>

<p>
He who spoke was Captain Hardinge, and
Kennedy, without a word, for his heart was very
full, accompanied him into the strong old citadel
of Corunna.  The church bells were tolling
midnight, and all was pitchy blackness around, for
the moon was hidden; but in the dim distance,
along the abandoned position on the hills, a line
of watch-fires burned like dim and wavering stars
to deceive the beaten but yet too powerful enemy.
</p>

<p>
The dim light of a lantern, upheld by a soldier,
shone faintly on a group of officers who
stood near, silent, sad, and thoughtful, and
leaning on their swords.  All were bareheaded.
Beside them lay a body muffled in a blue cloak
and a blanket soaked with blood&mdash;the mutilated
remains of Moore, for whom no coffin could be
procured.
</p>

<p>
Close by, a party of the 9th or East Norfolk
Regiment were digging a grave, and there stood
the chaplain-general, book in hand, but without
a surplice, for the sound of distant cannon
announced that the French, already discovering that
they were foiled, were pushing on to St. Lucia,
and hastened the interment.
</p>

<p>
The "lantern dimly burning" was held by
Sergeant Rollo, of the Artillery, who died lately
at Tynemouth, in his eighty-second year, and by
its fitful light the body was deposited in its last
home.
</p>

<p>
"Aid me, good gentlemen," said Colonel
Anderson, with a broken voice, as the aides-de-camp
lowered the remains into the rudely-dug hole,
Quentin as the youngest carrying the feet.  "It
is a strange fatality, this!  He always said that
if he fell in battle, he wished to be buried where
he died, and you see, gentlemen, his wish has
been fulfilled."
</p>

<p>
Near him lay his countryman, General Anstruther,
who had died of suffering and privations on
the march.
</p>

<p>
Hastily the burial service was read, and the
soldiers of the brave old 9th covered him up,
literally, "the sod with their bayonets turning."
</p>

<p>
All lingered for a few minutes near the spot,
and when they withdrew, there was not an eye
unmoistened among them.
</p>

<p>
Thus passed away Sir John Moore, like Wolfe,
in the moment of victory!
</p>

<p>
"A soldier from his earliest youth," says
General Napier, "he thirsted for the honours of
his profession, and feeling that he was worthy to
lead a British army, hailed the fortune that placed
him at the head of the troops destined for Spain.
The stream of time passed rapidly, and the
inspiring hopes of triumph disappeared, but the
austerer glory of suffering remained; with a firm
heart he accepted that gift of a severe fate, and
confiding in the strength of his genius,
disregarded the clamours of presumptuous ignorance;
opposing sound military views to the foolish
projects so insolently thrust upon him by the
ambassador, he conducted a long and arduous
retreat with sagacity, intelligence, and fortitude.
No insult could disturb, no falsehood deceive
him, no remonstrances shake his determination;
fortune frowned without subduing his constancy;
death struck, and the spirit of the man remained
unbroken, when his shattered body scarcely
afforded it habitation.  Having done all that was
just towards others, he remembered what was
due to himself.  Neither the shock of the mortal
blow, nor the lingering hours of acute pain
which preceded his dissolution, could quell the
pride of his gallant heart, or lower the feeling
with which (conscious of merit) he asserted his
right to the gratitude of the country he had
served so truly.
</p>

<p>
"If glory be a distinction, <i>for such a man
death is not a leveller</i>!"

<h3>
CHAPTER XXI.
<br /><br />
TOO LATE.
</h3>

<p class="intropoem">
  "The storm of fight is hushed; the mingled roar<br />
  Of charging squadrons swells the blast no more:<br />
  Gone are the bands of France; the crested pride<br />
  Of war, which lately clothed the mountain side,<br />
  Gone&mdash;as the winter cloud which tempests bear,<br />
  In broken shadows through the waste of air."<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Grey dawn came slowly in, stealing over land
and sea, as Quentin rode from the citadel of
Corunna.
</p>

<p>
It was difficult to believe that one night&mdash;one
short night only&mdash;filled the interval of time since
the fierce excitement of yesterday.  Within those
few hours how much had happened!  Many an
eye that met his with a kind smile was sightless
now, and many a cheerful and hearty voice with
which he was familiar was silenced for ever.
</p>

<p>
When passing through one of the streets, he
came suddenly upon Sir John Hope, who now
commanded the army, and who said, while reining
in his horse, which looked jaded and weary
as himself&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Oh&mdash;glad I've seen you, Mr. Kennedy; is
your horse fresh?"
</p>

<p>
"Tolerably so, sir," replied Quentin.
</p>

<p>
"Then you will oblige me by riding round by
the Santiago road, over the ground where Fraser's
division was posted yesterday, before he advanced
to support Paget, and bring off any stragglers you
may see there.  We have not a moment to lose,
as the French are getting several guns into
position above the San Diego Point, to open on our
transports."
</p>

<p>
Without waiting for an answer, and as if his
expressed wish was quite sufficient, the general
cantered off towards the mole.
</p>

<p>
No way delighted with this duty, in the grey
twilight of the morning, Quentin galloped through the
Pescadera, quitted the outer fortifications, issued
upon the road that led to Santiago de Compostella,
and ere long found himself on that which he had
now no heart to look upon&mdash;the field of battle&mdash;that
vast sepulchre&mdash;that ripe harvest of death
and suffering!
</p>

<p>
The dead were there mutilated in every
conceivable mode, and lying in every conceivable
position; some lay in little piles where the grape
had mowed them down.  Red-coat and blue-coat,
Frank and Briton, the red-trowsered Celt of Gaul
and the kilted Celt of Scotland, lay over each
other in heaps, many of them yet in the death
clutch of each other, but all sleeping peacefully
the long, long slumber that knows no waking.
It was a sad and terrible homily!
</p>

<p>
Muskets smashed at the stock, swords broken,
bayonets bent, caps crushed; belts, plumes, and
epaulettes torn; drums broken and bugles trod
flat; half-buried shot and exploded shells, strewed
all the ground, which was furrowed, torn up, and
soaked in blood; trees were barked and lopped by
the passing bullets, and hedges were scorched by fire.
</p>

<p>
Already the plunderers had been at work; an
officer, covered with wounds, lay stripped, nearly
nude, so his uniform had doubtless been a rich
one.  He was quite dead, and wore on his left
arm a bracelet of female hair&mdash;a love relic; his
head rested in the lap of a beautiful Spanish girl,
so dark that she was half like a mulatto or gitana
of Granada, and such she appeared to be by her
picturesque costume.  She was weeping bitterly,
and over her dark cheeks and quivering lips the
hot tears fell upon the cold face of the dead man.
Her sobs were quite inaudible, for her grief was
too deep for utterance.
</p>

<p>
Close by, with the medals of many an honourable
battle on his breast, lay a grey-haired
grenadier of the Garde ImpÃ©riale, who had died
about twenty minutes before, and the calm of
dissolution was smoothing out the wrinkles that
care, it might be a hidden sorrow, had traced upon
his now ghastly face&mdash;so smoothly then that he
became in aspect almost young again, as when,
perhaps, a conscript he left his father's cottage
and his mother's arms.
</p>

<p>
As Quentin rode on many called to him for
succour that he was unable to yield, and to their
piteous cries he was compelled to turn a deaf ear.
Many lay wounded, faint and unseen, among the
long rich grass, where they were lulled alike by
weakness and the hum of insect life awaking with
the rising sun; and these scarcely noticed him as
he trotted slowly past, carefully guiding his horse
among them.
</p>

<p>
Tormented by thirst, many crawled, like bruised
worms, to where a little runnel ran down the
green slope from San Cristoval, and drank
thirstily of its water in the hollow of their hands,
and without a shudder, though the purity of the
stream was tainted by blood, for further up lay a
soldier of the Cameron Highlanders, dead, with
his head buried in the stream.  He, too, had
crawled there; but the weight of his knapsack
had pressed his head and shoulders below the
water, and thus, unable to rise from weakness,
the poor fellow had actually been choked in a
hole about twelve inches deep.
</p>

<p>
No stragglers were visible, and an awful
stillness had succeeded to the roar of sound that
rung there yesternight; and now from his reverie
Quentin was roused by the boom of a cannon at a
distance.  Others followed rapidly, and at irregular
intervals.  It was the French guns above St. Lucia
firing over the flat point of San Diego on the
last of the transports and the last of our troops
who were embarking.  Hill's brigade had now
left the citadel, and Beresford, with the
rearguard, had already put off from the shore.
</p>

<p>
Such were the startling tidings Quentin
received from a mounted Spaniard, a fellow not
unlike a contrabandista, who passed, spurring
with his box-stirrups recklessly over the field
towards Santiago.  On hearing this, Quentin
instantly galloped towards the harbour.
</p>

<p>
It was too late now to think of getting his
horse off, so he resolved to abandon it and take
the first boat he could obtain.  The last of the
troops were gone now in the English launches,
and not a single Spanish barquero could he
prevail upon to put off; and so furious was the
cannonade which the French had opened from
the headland to the southward of Corunna, that
many of the masters of our crowded transports
cut their cables; four ran foul of each other and
went aground in shoal water.  Then, amid the
cries, cheers, uproar, and a thousand other sounds
on land and sea, the troops were removed from
them to others, and they were set on fire, while
the first ships of the fleet were standing out to
sea, and had already made an offing.
</p>

<p>
This delay nearly proved favourable to Quentin.
A Spanish boatman at last offered for ten duros
to take him off to the nearest ship, which lay
about a mile distant; but just as he dismounted to
embark, a yell of rage and terror was uttered by
the crowd upon the mole, and a party of French
light dragoons rode through them recklessly,
treading some under foot and sabreing others.
</p>

<p>
At the risk of being pistolled, Quentin was
about to spring into the sea, when an officer made
an attempt to cut him down, but his cap saved
his head from the first stroke.  In wild desperation,
with one hand he clung to the chasseur's
bridle, and with the other strove to grasp his
uplifted sword-arm.
</p>

<p>
"Rendez-vous!" cried the Frenchman, furiously.
</p>

<p>
"Eugene&mdash;sauvez-moi!" was all that Quentin
could utter, ere his assailant, whom at that
moment he recognised, cut him over the head,
and he fell, blinded in his own blood.
</p>

<p>
It was the <i>last</i> blow struck in our first
campaign in Spain.
</p>

<p>
When Quentin partially recovered he found
himself supported in the arms of the young
Lieutenant de Ribeaupierre, who was profuse in
his exclamations of sorrow and regret as he bound
the wound up with his own hands, and led him
away from the mole, expressing genuine anxiety
and commiseration.
</p>

<p>
"Take care of your prisoner, M. le Lieutenant,"
said an officer, authoritatively.  "<i>Sangdieu!</i> we
have not picked up so many!"
</p>

<p>
"I shall be answerable for him.  Ah, mon
Dieu! why did I not know you sooner?  Why
did you not speak first, my dear friend?"
Ribeaupierre continued to repeat.
</p>

<p>
The captain of his troop gave them a stern and
scrutinizing glance.  He was a forbidding looking
man, with that swaggering spur-and-sabre-clattering
bearing peculiar to some of those who had
found their epaulettes on the barricades or among
the ruins of the Bastile&mdash;a species of military
ruffian, whose bearing was tempered only by the
politeness which all military discipline&mdash;French
especially&mdash;infuses in the manners of men.
</p>

<p>
"Take his sword away," said this personage,
gruffly.
</p>

<p>
"Eugene, ask him if I may retain it&mdash;it was
the last gift of Sir John Moore?" said Quentin,
with intense anxiety.
</p>

<p>
"That is well&mdash;you shall keep it, monsieur,"
said the gruff captain; "Sir John Moore was
indeed a soldier!"
</p>

<p>
"Am I, then, a prisoner?" said Quentin, with
a sigh of intense bitterness, as he looked after
the distant ships, now beyond even the range of
the guns at San Diego, and bearing away with
all their sails set&mdash;away for England!
</p>

<p>
"My captain has seen you&mdash;it must be so,"
replied Ribeaupierre, leading him into the city;
"but prisoner or not, remember, mon ami, that
you are with <i>me</i>."
</p>

<p>
The measured tramp of infantry was now heard,
and guarded by fixed bayonets, some thirty or
forty British prisoners passed with an air of sullen
defiance in their faces and bearing. They were
men of all regiments, gleaned up on the field or
in the suburbs, and they were marched towards
the citadel. Quentin gave a convulsive start as
he recognised the face of Cosmo among them!
</p>

<p>
He saw Quentin covered with blood&mdash;wounded
to all appearance severely, and a prisoner too; so
he gave him a parting smile full of malignity
and hate.
</p>

<p>
Quentin cared not for this, he sprang forward
to speak with him; but at that moment the
blood burst forth afresh, his senses reeled, and he
fainted.
</p>

<p>
On that evening the tricolour was seen hoisted
half-mast high on the citadel of Corunna, and the
British fleet, though "far away on the billow,"
could hear the French artillery as they fired a
funeral salute over the grave of Sir John Moore,
in a spirit that was worthy of France and the
best days of France's chivalry!
</p>

<p>
True it is, indeed, that "he whose talents
exacted the praises of Soult, of Wellington, and of
NAPOLEON, could be no ordinary soldier."
</p>

<p>
But there was one in whose heart a blank
remained that no posthumous honours could ever
fill up&mdash;the heart of his mother, to whom Sir
John Moore was ever a tender and affectionate
son, and whom he loved with great filial devotion.
</p>

<p>
It was not for some weeks after all this that
Quentin learned that the Master of Rohallion had
been sent a prisoner of war to Verdun, in the
department of the Meuse, where his fierce pride
having procured him the enmity of the commandant,
he could never effect an exchange; thus
he remained on parole five long and miserable
years, even until the battle of Toulouse was
fought; and, in the meantime, worthy old Jack
Middleton recovered from his wound, and was
appointed lieutenant-colonel of the 2nd Battalion
of the King's Own Borderers.

CHAPTER XXII.
<br /><br />
MADAME DE RIBEAUPIERRE.
</h3>

<p class="intropoem">
  "Who should it be?  Where shouldst thou look for kindness?<br />
  When we are sick, where can we look for succour?<br />
  When we are wretched, where can we complain?<br />
  And when the world looks cold and surly on us,<br />
  Where can we go to meet a warmer eye<br />
  With such sure confidence as to a mother?"<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;JOANNA BAILLIE.<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
A month after the occurrence of the stirring events
we have just narrated, Quentin Kennedy found
himself an inmate of the same house with his
young French friend at Corunna&mdash;the pretty villa
that faced the bay of Orsan, the same mansion
in which the Master of Rohallion spent that
remarkable night before the battle.
</p>

<p>
General de Ribeaupierre had been appointed
by Marshal Soult military governor of the town
and citadel of Corunna, in which there was a
strong French garrison; but instead of occupying
the gloomy quarters assigned to the governor,
Madame de Ribeaupierre, who had joined him,
preferred the little Villa de Orsan near the coast,
and had prevailed upon him to place Eugene on
his staff as an aide-de-camp, and thus the whole
of her household now seemed, for the time, to
be peacefully located in that remote corner of
Gallicia.
</p>

<p>
Both madame and her husband the general
were considerably past the prime of life.  He
was a fine courtly gentleman of the old French
school, and in his secret heart was a sincere
monarchist, but not so rashly as to oppose in act
or spirit the tide of events which had replaced the
line of St. Louis by Napoleon, with whom he
had served early in life, as we have before stated,
in the Regiment of La Fere.
</p>

<p>
Madame might still be called handsome, though
long past forty.  Perfectly regular, finely cut,
and having all the impress of good birth and high
culture, her features were remarkably beautiful.
Her manner was singularly sweet, gentle, and
pleasing; yet she had an eye and a lip indicative
of a proud and lofty spirit, that had enabled her
to confront the blackest horrors of the Revolution
in France.
</p>

<p>
Powdered white as snow, she wore her hair
dressed back over a little cushion, with a few
stray ringlets falling behind in the coquettish
manner of the old Bourbon days (when patches
and pomatum were in all their glory), while her
full bust, plump white arms, her short sleeves
with long elbow-gloves, her peaked stomacher
and her amplitude of brocade skirt, with many
a deep flounce and frill of old Maltese lace, all
made her a pleasing picture at a time when, in
imitation of the prevailing French taste, the
English woman of fashion wore a huge muslin
cap, her waist under her armpits, and her skirts so
tight that she resembled nothing in this world
but a long bolster set on end.
</p>

<p>
Knowing how much the young prisoner of war
and Eugene owed to each other, and how much
the former had suffered recently under the sabre
of the latter, she rivalled her husband in kindness,
and was unremitting in her hospitality, her
nursing, and her motherly attention.
</p>

<p>
Quentin had the care of the best surgeons on
the French staff&mdash;a class of medical men who
far excelled the rabble of apothecary boys then
commissioned for the British army; the cool
season of the year was favourable for his
recovering from such an ugly slash on the caput
as Eugene's steel had bestowed; so, our hero,
having youth and health on his side, grew rapidly
well, and by the 16th of February&mdash;one month
after the battle&mdash;he had become quite convalescent;
but politeness even could scarcely make
him repress his impatience to begone; yet he
knew that, though the guest of General Ribeaupierre,
he was still a prisoner of war, and could not
leave any French territory until duly exchanged.
</p>

<p>
During his illness he had many a strange and
fantastic dream of Flora and of home.  But now
there came to him dim memories of an infancy
<i>beyond</i> that spent at Rohallion; there was the
quaint foreign town, with its winding river, its
antique bridge, its boats and windmills.  Like a
dream, or some vision of mystic memory, he
remembered this place in all its details and features,
and with them came the old and confused recollection
of a lady, it might be, nay, it <i>must</i> have
been, his own mother, in rich velvet with
powdered hair.  Then came his father's face, pale
and despairing, and the night of the wreck at
the Partan Craig, all jumbled oddly together.
</p>

<p>
Was it a sense of pre-existence&mdash;that sense
felt by so many at different times&mdash;that haunted
him?
</p>

<p>
Was it a sense of the <i>unreality</i> of the present
f conflicting with the certainty of the past?
</p>

<p>
We cannot say; but there came upon his mind
a strange consciousness that this scene, this river,
with its town and woods and hills, this lady in
velvet and powder, were not creations of the
fancy, and were not new to him.
</p>

<p>
Was it a phase of that which is termed by
Dr. Wigan the "duality of the human mind," which
comes upon us at times&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "As when with downcast eyes we muse and brood,<br />
  <i>And ebb into a former life?</i>"<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
We pretend not to say; but poor Quentin was
sorely puzzled, and that sabre cut in no way made
his reasoning faculties clearer.
</p>

<p>
His room, a large one facing the bay of Orsan,
was decorated for him daily by a quantity of
beautiful flowers, which madame procured from
the conservatory of the captain-general&mdash;flowers so
charming at that season&mdash;scarlet and white camellias,
rare geraniums, and glorious roses of every
hue; while in the trellis-work verandah without
were magnolias and creeping plants whose tendrils
were covered with odoriferous flowers, through
which the sea-breeze came, blending and mingling
pleasantly with the fragrant and earthy odour of
the tiled floor, which was daily sprinkled with
spring water.
</p>

<p>
And there in a softly-cushioned easy-chair he
sat for hours gazing dreamily out upon the sunlit
bay, where the brown Spanish fisher-boats, with
lateen sails striped red and white, manned by
dark and picturesque-looking fellows in shirts and
caps of scarlet and blue, were always preparing
for sea, or tacking out of the bay with the white
foam curling under the bows&mdash;a life of movement
and bustle that contrasted sadly with his
own inertia and made him feverish with impatience.
</p>

<p>
Even Eugene's aspect, as he came clattering
and rattling to and fro, between the citadel and
the villa, in uniform and accoutred with spurs
and sabre, showed that the game of life was still
played briskly by others, and fretted Quentin's
soul.
</p>

<p>
"A prisoner," he repeated to himself, "and
for heaven knows how long!  Is this the fruit
of my ambition?  Is this the prize I have
striven, struggled, and starved&mdash;fought and bled
for during all the horrors of that campaign?
Unlucky indeed was the hour when Hope sent
me beyond the city on a bootless errand, and
when Eugene cut me down on that accursed
beach!  Captivity even thus, though surrounded
by every kindness and luxury, is more than I can
either bear or endure!  Besides," he added,
bitterly, aloud, "I may be reported dead or
missing, and Flora&mdash;may&mdash;might&mdash;and my
commission too&mdash;may be cancelled."
</p>

<p>
"No, no, my good young friend," said Madame
de Ribeaupierre, who had entered unheard; "my
husband, the general, saw all that properly
arranged, and despatched Eugene in person, with a
memorandum of your name and regiment, to the
commissaire for British prisoners, to inform him
that we had you here, where we mean to keep
you as long as we can."
</p>

<p>
"It was most kind, dear madame," said Quentin,
bowing low to hide confusion for his petulance,
and leading the lady to a chair close by his
own.
</p>

<p>
"Kind, monsieur, say you?  It was but just
and proper that your friends should know of your
safety," said she, with a bending of the neck, a
species of bow that reminded Quentin of old
Lady Rohallion; for this Frenchwoman had all
that old-fashioned grace which, in Scotland, died
with the Jacobites, and in France expired with
the monarchy.  "Judging by my own fears and
emotions, I was most anxious that&mdash;that your
mother, I presume, should know that you, at
least, had not perished on that unhappy 16th of
January."
</p>

<p>
"My mother," repeated Quentin, and with the
memory of his recent dreams a thrill of sadness
came over his heart, as he looked into the fine
dark eyes of this noble French matron, who
seemed so inspired by feminine tenderness and
commiseration that she placed her white hand
caressingly on the half-healed scar which Quentin's
short crisp hair but partially concealed.
</p>

<p>
"A naughty boy was my Eugene to do this,
but he has never ceased to deplore it.  Yes, your
mother; ah, mon Dieu! it was well that she did
not see as I saw you, after the mischief Eugene
wrought, when the Chasseurs of the 24th carried
you into the citadel covered with blood!  Yet,
if she knew all, she might safely trust you with
me; for I have known what it is to lose a child
ere this, and others whom I loved dearly&mdash;to be
left alone, reft of that being whom I hoped was
to love and remember me long after I had passed
away.  Eugene is a good boy, and I love him
dearly; but you&mdash;your mother, mon ami?"
</p>

<p>
"Madame, I have no mother."
</p>

<p>
"Mon Dieu! and you so young!"
</p>

<p>
"No, nor any relation in the world," said
Quentin, in a voice half angry and half broken,
"save some brave friends who died at Corunna,
and one in Scotland, far away, I never had any
who loved me."
</p>

<p>
"L'Ecosse&mdash;l'Ecosse!" repeated Madame de
Ribeaupierre with sudden interest.  "We
old-fashioned French love the memory of the old
alliances when our royal houses so often
intermarried, and still respect the land where the line
of St. Louis finds a home; and so," she added,
with kindling eyes, "monsieur is an Ecossais?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, madame, I have every reason to believe so?"
</p>

<p>
"To believe&mdash;only to believe, monsieur?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, madame."
</p>

<p>
"How?"
</p>

<p>
"It is my secret," said Quentin, smiling.
</p>

<p>
"Pardonnez-moi?" said madame, colouring
slightly.
</p>

<p>
"My name is one of the oldest in Scotland."
</p>

<p>
"True&mdash;true; mon Dieu!  I know there are
earls of that name who have the tressure florÃ©
and counterflorÃ© in their coat-of-arms," said she,
while a sad and beautiful smile lit up her fine
face, and she smoothed her powdered hair with a
tremulous hand.  "I had a dear friend who
once bore the name&mdash;but it was in the old days
of the monarchy, and for the sake of that friend
I shall love you more than ever;" and patting
Quentin on the head, she kissed him on the brow
just as her son entered with a servant in livery,
who came to announce that the carriage was at
the door.
</p>

<p>
"Tres bien, Louis," said she; "monsieur will
accompany us, Eugene, the day is so fine; he
shall take his first drive with me, and you may
follow on horseback if you choose.  I don't like
spurs in a carriage."
</p>

<p>
"I shall be very happy, my dear madame,
though our mutual friend, the General de Ribeaupierre,
has seen fit to send me no less than four
times this morning with absurd messages to the
sappers who are repairing the bridge of El Burgo,"
replied Eugene, whose boots and light-green
uniform bore evident traces of mud.
</p>

<p>
"Come, Eugene, and never mind; as I am
only your mamma, and not your intended, you
have no need to be so particular with your
toilet; and if your horse is weary, order a fresh
one."
</p>

<p>
Quentin enjoyed the drive greatly, as it was
his first active step towards final recovery and
strength.
</p>

<p>
It was the evening of a clear and sunny day&mdash;one
of the earliest of spring&mdash;and Quentin surveyed,
with equal delight and interest, the long
lines of massive bastions, towers, and battlemented
walls that enclosed the town and citadel of
Corunna&mdash;that vast stone frontage, with all its
rows of grim cannon that peered through dark
port-holes or frowned <i>en barbette</i>, steeped in the
warm radiance of a red setting sun that tinged
the sea and surf with the hue of blood, sinking
every alternate angle of the fortifications in deep
and solemn shadow.
</p>

<p>
The music of a French regimental band came
floating pleasantly from time to time on the thin
air, as they played the grand march of the
Emperor along the ramparts; and now the carriage,
by Eugene's desire, was stopped near a part of
the citadel where Sir John Moore's grave lay,
and where the French sappers were already
building the great granite monument which the noble
Soult erected to his memory, and which the
Marquis of Romana completed.
</p>

<p>
Quentin descended from the carriage and
approached the spot.
</p>

<p>
He was the last, the only British soldier in
Corunna now.  He sat down on one of the blocks
and looked wistfully at the place where he knew
the poor shattered corse lay uncoffined.  Then
the manly figure, the gentle face, the soldierly
presence, and the winning manner of Moore came
vividly to memory, and Quentin covered his eyes
with his hand, as he could not control his emotion.
</p>

<p>
He was the last solitary mourner by the grave
of him whose memory Charles Wolfe embalmed
in verse.
</p>

<p>
The French sappers, who had been singing and
laughing gaily at their work, respected his grief;
they became quite silent, and saluted him with
great politeness.  Then Madame de Ribeaupierre
took him by the hand and they drove away.
</p>

<p>
In the general's well-hung, cosy, and handsome
Parisian carriage, he passed more than once over
the field of battle.  Its sad dÃ©bris had vanished
now; the people of the adjacent villages had
gleaned up every bullet and button.  The dead
were buried in trenches.  Here and there might
lie a solitary grave, but already the young spring
grass was growing over them all.  Quentin knew
the ground where the Borderers had been posted,
and thus he knew which of those fatal mounds
was likely to hold the noble and true-hearted
Rowland Askerne, Colville, and others whom he
knew and mourned for.
</p>

<p>
Even the <i>Ã©tourdi</i> Eugene was silent, when, for
the last time, they surveyed the field.
</p>

<p>
"Here the 24th charged a square of one of
your Scots regiments," said he; "and here fell
poor Jules de MarbÅ“uf.  It was his last battle."
</p>

<p>
"Killed?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes&mdash;dead as Hector, by some of your bare-legged
Scotsmen, who took the eagle of the 24th.
<i>Sacre Dieu!</i>&mdash;think of that!"*
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
* In February after the battle, two French eagles, each
weighing fifteen ounces of silver, were sold to a silversmith
in Chichester by a soldier of the 92nd Highlanders, who said
that he had bayoneted the Frenchmen, and brought the
trophies home in his knapsack.&mdash;<i>Annual Register</i> for 1809.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"And Donna Isidora?" said Quentin, not
caring much about the eagle.
</p>

<p>
"The sorrowful widow&mdash;<i>peste!</i> she is at Lugo
with the Light Division."
</p>

<p>
"She is not coming here, I trust?"
</p>

<p>
"Can't say, mon camarade; but pardieu, I
should hope not."
</p>

<p>
Though Quentin knew that his commission
and promotion in the 7th Fusiliers were now both
secured, he writhed under the idea of being a
prisoner of war; but there was no help for it.  He
had given his parole of honour, and by that he
was bound to abide.
</p>

<p>
Not even the keen longing to see Flora, to tell
his story and lay his laurels, while they were yet
fresh, at her feet, could lure him to break his
bonds; but being intensely wearied of Corunna,
he hailed with extreme satisfaction a change in
the plans of the really delightful family with
whom he resided.
</p>

<p>
Tidings of a new and more powerful expedition,
destined to drive the French from Spain, under Sir
Arthur Wellesley, the future Duke of Wellington,
had now come to all the Emperor's marshals and
garrisons officially; and thus General de Ribeaupierre
resolved on sending his lady, in charge of
Eugene, to Paris, whither they begged Quentin
to accompany them.
</p>

<p>
Anything was better than lingering in Corunna
or setting out for Verdun; and so, bidding adieu
to the kind old general, within a few weeks after his
convalescence, Quentin found himself kindly
adjusting the wraps and mufflings of madame on
the deck of the <i>Bien AimÃ©</i>, a privateer brig,
mounting six 12-pounders, M. Marin, captain,
bound for the mouth of the Loire; and long did
he and Eugene pace the deck together that night,
building castles, exchanging confidences, and
smoking cigars, while the wild waves of the Bay
of Biscay tore past in dark ridges to leeward, and
the last of the Galician hills, the great Sierra de
Mondonedo, sank into the dark world of waters
astern.

CHAPTER XXIII.
<br /><br />
THE "BIEN AIMÃ‰."
</h3>

<p class="intropoem">
  "He had fought the red English, he said,<br />
  In many a battle in Spain;<br />
  He cursed the red English, and prayed<br />
  To meet and fight them again!"&mdash;THACKERAY.<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
<i>Le Bien AimÃ©</i> encountered very rough weather,
and beat hard against the westerly winds which
always prevail in the stormy Bay of Biscay, where
the broad waves of the Atlantic roll in all their
full and unbroken weight.
</p>

<p>
The third night was so dark and gusty, that
neither Quentin Kennedy nor Eugene de Ribeaupierre
turned in, but remained at the table much
later than usual, listening to the somewhat
piratical yarns and experiences of M. Jehan Marin, a
short, thick-set, and savage-looking fellow, who
wore a tricoloured nightcap, a pea-jacket, and a
broad black belt, with a square brass buckle of most
melodramatic size.  He viewed Quentin evidently
with intense dislike, as one of those sacrÃ© Anglais,
whom he hated as so many snakes or other reptiles,
and to this sentiment was added a profound
contempt for him as a soldier.  Quentin was soon
sensible of all this, but deemed it neither safe nor
worth his while to notice it; besides, the life of a
prisoner of war was deemed of very little value by
land or sea in those days.
</p>

<p>
On this night, just as they went on deck to
have a last glance at the pitchy blackness amid
which <i>Le Bien AimÃ©</i> was careering, a flash broke
through it, and a cannon-shot boomed across her
forefoot; another flash followed, and the shot
went through her foresail, which was bellying out
upon the wind.
</p>

<p>
"Tonnerre de Dieu! what is that?" cried M. Marin,
choking and sputtering with passion and
alarm, as he jumped upon a carronade and peered
to windward, from whence the assault came, but
could see nothing, so intense was the darkness.
</p>

<p>
Boom! another heavy gun came, and now he
could make out a strange ship, looming large and
black on the larboard bow, and carrying an
enormous spread of canvas, considering the nature of
the night, and it was the guns of her starboard-quarter
that were tickling <i>Le Bien AimÃ©</i> in this
rough fashion.
</p>

<p>
"Nombril de Beelzebub!" bellowed Captain
Marin, "here we are in action without seeing or
knowing who the devil it is with!  Beat to
quarters&mdash;pipe up the hammocks and open the magazine!"
</p>

<p>
Just as he was speaking and gesticulating
furiously, another shot knocked the fiddle-head of
the <i>Bien AimÃ©</i> all to splinters; so matters were
looking decidedly serious.  By this time, and long
ere the drum beat, his crew, half dressed, were all
at their quarters, and the hammocks were bundled
anyhow into the side nettings.
</p>

<p>
"Clear away those weather-guns&mdash;cast loose
the lashings, and load!" shouted Marin; "stand
by the watch to shorten sail; 'way aloft and hand
the topgallant sails; small-arm men, aft, and
blaze away!"
</p>

<p>
<i>Le Bien AimÃ©</i> was now hove full in the wind's
eye, so that the next shot from this strange ship
went no one knew where.
</p>

<p>
There were terrible confusion, growling,
swearing, with lack of discipline, on board, but
no lack of pluck among the crew, and fifty
of the most finished ragamuffins that ever
sailed from the Loire or Brest stood to their
guns.
</p>

<p>
The next cannon that flashed from the strange
ship made Quentin, who clung to a belaying pin
on the port side, spring backwards involuntarily,
the red light of the explosion seemed so close;
but it enabled him to see for an instant the large
ship with her lee side full of men.
</p>

<p>
"She is a frigate, at least!" exclaimed Marin,
with a frightful oath, as he drew his cutlass; "we
cannot fight her; she may be French, and the
whole affair a mistake, though: hush, silence fore
and aft&mdash;they are hailing!"
</p>

<p>
"Ho&mdash;brig ahoy!" sang out a voice in most
unmistakeable English.
</p>

<p>
Jehan Marin ground his yellow teeth&mdash;those
cursed English!  Could he doubt that any but
they would first fire and then question?
</p>

<p>
"Hallo!" he replied.
</p>

<p>
"What brig is that?" hailed the officer, through
a trumpet, and Quentin felt his heart beating
wildly with anxiety and anticipation.  Next
moment he heard Eugene and the French skipper
engaged in a brief but very angry expostulation.
</p>

<p>
"What is the matter?" he asked, as Eugene
joined him.
</p>

<p>
"Don't inquire," said he, "lest I blush that I
am a Frenchman."
</p>

<p>
"Then your conference concerned me?"
</p>

<p>
"It certainly did, mon ami."
</p>

<p>
"How?"
</p>

<p>
"Marin wished to force you to deceive your
countrymen, by replying to them in English&mdash;replying
with his pistol at your head.  <i>Sangdieu!</i>
you comprehend?"
</p>

<p>
Before Quentin could reply, the question,
</p>

<p>
"What brig is that? d&mdash;n it, you had better
look sharp!" came over the black surging water
from the foe.
</p>

<p>
"Stand by the braces, and be ready to fill the
sails to the yard-heads, and bear away right
before the wind," said Marin; then, raising his
voice, he shouted a deep and bitter curse through
his trumpet.
</p>

<p>
"Hail again," cried the officer; "this is His
Britannic Majesty's ship <i>Medusa</i>&mdash;send a boat
off instantly with your skipper and his papers."
</p>

<p>
Instead of complying, Marin daringly gave
orders to fire his three 12-pounders on the portside,
to fill his yards, and bear right away before
the western breeze; but on the appearance of the
first portfire glittering on his deck, bang came
another shot from this pugnacious stranger, which
took his foreyard right in the sling; it came
crashing down on deck, breaking the arm of one
man and the leg of another; and before M. Marin
had made up his mind what to do next, the
<i>Medusa</i>, a fifty-gun ship, forged a little way ahead
of him, as if she meant to sweep his deck or
sink him; but neither was her object, for a boat's
crew of those "pestilent Englishmen," with pistols
in their belts and cutlasses in their teeth, were
alongside in a moment, holding on with
boat-hooks to the forechains, as the now partly
unmanageable brig rose and fell heavily on the black
waves of that stormy midnight sea.  Another
boat-load clung like leeches to the starboard
quarter, and in less than five minutes the <i>Bien
AimÃ©</i> was the lawful prize of the British frigate,
<i>Medusa</i>.
</p>

<p>
Her crew were all disarmed and placed under
a guard of marines; a strong hawser was run on
board and made fast to the capstan or windlass,
the yard heads were trimmed, a jury fore-yard
rigged in a trice, and the privateer in tow of the
<i>Medusa</i> stood off towards the coast of "perfidious
Albion."  The weather was so rough, however,
that they were compelled to slack off or let go
the towline; but lanterns were hoisted at the
foreyard, and thus they kept company till daylight.
</p>

<p>
"Fortune changes," said Eugene, laughing
with all the nonchalance of a Frenchman; "you
are now free, and I am a prisoner."
</p>

<p>
The prize-master, a rough and somewhat elderly
man for a middy&mdash;one of those hardworking
fellows whose boast it used to be that they came
into the service through the hawse-holes,
questioned the cabin passengers sharply and
categorically.
</p>

<p>
"You, sir," said he, looking at Eugene, cutlass
in hand; "what are you?"
</p>

<p>
"Eugene de Ribeaupierre, sous-lieutenant in
the French service, and ready to give my parole."
</p>

<p>
"Keep it till we are at Spithead; and you,
sir," he added, turning furiously to Quentin,
"are an Englishman, I see, and in the French
service too&mdash;eh?"
</p>

<p>
"No, sir; I happen to be a Scotsman, and in
the British service."
</p>

<p>
"Where are your papers?"
</p>

<p>
"I have none."
</p>

<p>
"Oho; d&mdash;n me! you have none?" said he,
suspiciously.
</p>

<p>
"No; but my name is recorded in the ship's
books as a prisoner of war, a lieutenant in the
7th Fusiliers, proceeding to Paris on parole."
</p>

<p>
The mid shook Quentin's hand on hearing this,
and ordered a jorum of grog, in which Eugene
good-naturedly joined him, remarking&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Ma foi, monsieur, don't be too sure of having
us at the Spithead."
</p>

<p>
"Why not, if the wind holds good?"
</p>

<p>
"Some of our ships may retake us&mdash;aha!"
</p>

<p>
"No fear of that, mounseer; the sea at
present is only open to <i>us</i>," was the composed
reply.
</p>

<p>
Marin, who sat in a corner, imprecated his
fate bitterly; he cursed what he considered
Eugene's squeamishness, which prevented him
from availing himself compulsorily of Quentin's
aid to deceive the <i>Medusa</i>; but consoled himself
by the hope that "he would yet take it out of
the hides of those 'sacrÃ© Anglais,' in some fashion
or other."
</p>

<p>
"Take up the slack of your jawing-tackle,
Johnny," said the mid; "drink your grog, shut
up, and turn in; your ill luck to-night may be
mine to-morrow."
</p>

<p>
Madame de Ribeaupierre was greatly concerned
by the turn her affairs had taken; but at a time
when the whole sea was covered by the cruisers
of the largest fleet in the world, it was strange
that she did not anticipate some such catastrophe.
</p>

<p>
When it was reported to the captain of the
<i>Medusa</i> that the wife of General de Ribeaupierre
was in the <i>Bien AimÃ©</i>, he politely offered her the
use of a cabin on board his ship; but having no
wish to be separated from Eugene, she continued
in the privateer, with which the frigate kept
company for several days, until she saw her close in
shore under the white cliffs of Old England, when
she brought her starboard tacks on board, and,
like a great eagle in search of fresh prey, stood
over towards the coast of France. Thus, on the
evening of the 16th of March, exactly two months
after the battle of Corunna, Quentin found the
<i>Bien AimÃ©</i> safely anchored at Spithead, close by
the guns of a line-of-battle ship.
</p>

<p>
There Eugene gave his parole, and Quentin
found himself a free man!
</p>

<p>
The news spread rapidly in Portsmouth and in
the Isle of Wight that the wife and son of
Bonaparte's favourite cavalry officer, the Governor of
Corunna, had been brought in as prisoners; and
thus, on the very day they were preparing to go
on shore, escorted by Quentin, a staff-officer,
in full uniform, came fussily on board in a boat
pulled by marines.
</p>

<p>
Quentin recognised in him Lloyd Conyers, the
aide-de-camp, whom he had frequently seen in
Spain.
</p>

<p>
He had come, he stated, "by direction of the
General commanding in the Isle of Wight, to
invite Madame de Ribeaupierre, with her friends
and attendants, to share the hospitality of his
house&mdash;to consider it as her home, in fact, until
she could make such arrangements as she wished."
</p>

<p>
"Is the general married, monsieur?" asked
madame, smiling; "for I am not so very old."
</p>

<p>
"Madame, the general is married, and is
nearer seventy than sixty," replied Conyers,
laughing behind his great staff plume. "A boat
is in readiness, and a carriage awaits you on the
beach. The general lives at Minden Lodge,
St. Helen's&mdash;we dine at half-past six."
</p>

<p>
Madame de Ribeaupierre, who was considerably
crushed and crestfallen, accepted the general's
offer; and accompanied by her maid, who had
many misgivings and vague terrors of the natives,
by her son and her aide-de-camp, as she laughingly
styled Quentin, landed in the Isle of Wight;
and for the first time in her life found herself
treading English ground.

</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The month was only March; but in that southern
portion of England, the white daisy and the
golden buttercup already spotted the green sward;
the hedge-rows nearly in full leaf, were quite like
bird-meadows, so full were they of song; while
the coo of the ring-dove and the wild pigeon were
already heard in the copse.  The gardens teemed
with beautiful flowers, and the air was delicious,
the heat of the great white chalky cliffs being
tempered by the breeze from the deep blue sea.
</p>

<p>
When the three guests reached his residence at
St. Helen's, the general and all his suite were
absent, at the inspection of the parochial artillery;
for even then, so lately as the days of Corunna,
the ancient custom of each parish in the Isle of
Wight providing itself with one small piece of
cannon, usually a six-pounder, to be kept in the
church, or some small house built for the
purpose close by, was still in force; and the recent
threats of invasion had made the islanders somewhat
expert as gunners, in handling their brigade
of some thirty field-pieces.
</p>

<p>
Built on an eminence at the pretty village
of St.  Helen's, near the mouth of the Bradinghaven,
Minden Lodge was a spacious and handsome
mansion; and though the three visitors knew
not the names of the localities, from the lofty
windows of the spacious and elegant drawing-room,
they had a fine view of Calshot Castle, of
Portsmouth steeped in sunny haze, about seven
miles distant, its harbour crowded with shipping;
Spithead, with all the men-of-war at anchor, and
the little <i>Bien AimÃ©</i>, with the union-jack waving
above her tricolour; while far off in distance rose
the taper spire of Chichester Cathedral.
</p>

<p>
The rolling of carriage wheels upon gravel
walks, the opening and shutting of doors,
announced the return of the general's party from
the inspection; but for a time no one appeared,
and already the hands of the ormolu clock
indicated a quarter past six.
</p>

<p>
Madame had made rather an elaborate toilet;
her maid had dressed and powdered her fine hair
to perfection, and she was in all the amplitude
of her flowered brocade and rich black lace, her
antique steel and diamond ornaments, a gift
from the Grand Monarque to her grandmother
the Marquise de Louvre; Eugene had on the full
uniform of the 24th Chasseurs Ã  Cheval, minus
only his sword; Quentin felt himself obliged to
appear in some kind of uniform, too (mufti was
vulgar then), and so had carefully brushed up his
old and worn-out volunteer coat of the 25th, to
which he added a pair of silver epaulettes and
a crimson sash, bought from a Jew of Corunna,
who had no doubt found them on the field.
</p>

<p>
They were sorely discoloured and torn; but
he had the handsome gold belt and the sabre of
General Colbert&mdash;the gift of Moore.  Embrowned,
taller, fuller, manlier, and looking even more
handsome than ever, he was not astonished at
being totally unrecognised; though he was startled,
and beyond description bewildered, when the
familiar voice of old Jack Andrews (who was clad
in the Crawford livery), as he threw open the
drawing-room door, announced "Lord and Lady
Rohallion, Miss Warrender, <i>and</i> Captain Conyers."
</p>

<p>
Looking not a day older, but rather younger
and better than when he had seen them last,
Lord Rohallion entered in the full uniform of a
general officer, as orthodoxly powdered and pig-tailed
as ever; Lady Winifred in all the plenitude
of her old-fashioned costume, with her high-dressed
hair puffed and white as snow, and looking,
though senior in years, somewhat the counterpart
of Madame de Ribeaupierre, her necklace and
ornaments being equally antique, with opals and
diamonds that were <i>reversible</i> in the course of an
entertainment; and there, too, was Flora, looking
so charming, so dove-eyed, and blooming, in full
dress for dinner, but leaning on the arm of a
lisping and most-decidedly-too-attentive puppy of
an aide-de-camp.
</p>

<p>
So confounded was Quentin by the sudden appearance
of these four persons, that he stood as
if rooted to the carpet, unable to speak or advance,
while apologies were profusely made by Lord and
Lady Rohallion for their absence at the inspection
on Bemerston Downs.
</p>

<p>
"You will make this house your home, my
dear Madame de Ribeaupierre," said Lady Winifred,
"until you choose to leave it for Paris&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"We shall be in no hurry arranging the cartel
for that," said Lord Rohallion; "though I have
no doubt," he added to Eugene, "you will be
impatient to rejoin your regiment&mdash;light cavalry,
I think?"  Eugene bowed very low; "and this
gentleman&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Monsieur Kennedy&mdash;a name once very dear
to me," said Madame de Ribeaupierre, presenting
Quentin; "and dearer now again for the services
he and my Eugene have performed for each other."
</p>

<p>
Lord Rohallion bowed, and shook the hand of
Quentin cordially, but did not remark his features
particularly, till the expression of astonishment
and joy, half mingled by doubt and fear, which
he saw, while surveying alternately the faces of
Flora and Lady Winifred, attracted all his attention.
</p>

<p>
"Quentin&mdash;Quentin Kennedy!" they exclaimed
together.  Flora seemed tottering and
deadly pale; but Lady Rohallion threw herself
into his arms, and sobbed hysterically.
</p>

<p>
Conyers played with the tassels of his sash,
and thought himself decidedly in the way....
</p>

<p>
Brief and rapid were the questions asked, and
explanations given now; other guests came
crowding in till the dinner-party was complete, and
Jack Andrews made the gong send its thunder
from the vestibule: thus they were compelled to
compose themselves, nor indulge in that which
well-bred English society so eminently abhors&mdash;a
scene.
</p>

<p>
"I was thought too old to command a brigade
in the field, Quentin," said Lord Rohallion,
shaking the hand of his young friend, at least for
the sixth time; "so the Duke of York kindly
sent me to this quiet place.  If the flat-bottomed
boats ever leave Boulogne, they will find me,
however, at my post; and, egad!  I hope to show
them there is life in the old dog yet!"
</p>

<p>
Conyers, the aide, who no doubt usually acted
as esquire to la belle Flora, was considerably put
out&mdash;disgusted, in fact&mdash;when he found her
completely appropriated by another; while he was
compelled to offer his arm to the buxom wife of
an adjutant of a Veteran battalion.
</p>

<p>
"Flora!"
</p>

<p>
"Quentin!"
</p>

<p>
They had no other words for each other, even
in whispers, as they went mechanically to the
dining-room, where all the cold formality of a
grand state dinner was to be enacted and endured.
</p>

<p>
A strange throbbing thrill ran through Quentin's
heart, as memory went back to that last
meeting in the sycamore avenue, and <i>the last kiss</i>
given there, as he seemed with the touch of her
hand to take up the long-dropped link of a life
that had passed away&mdash;his boyish life of joy and
love at Rohallion&mdash;long dropped, but never forgotten!
</p>

<p>
They were young, but, strange to say, in their
instance, separation for a time, instead of cooling,
strengthened their mutual regard; and when Flora
spoke, the old familiar sound of her soft and
beloved voice made the tender link complete.
</p>

<p>
She drew off her glove and smilingly held up
a little white hand.  There was but one ring on
it&mdash;the diamond gift of Madame de Ribeaupierre,
sent at a time when Quentin had no other gift
to send; and the curious history of it afforded
them ample conversation during dinner.  As for
Eugene, who sat opposite, he seemed immensely
consoled, under his unhappy circumstances, by a
blue-eyed and fair ringleted daughter of the
Commissary General from Newport, that young
lady's patriotic animosity to France seeming in
no way to extend to a handsome young fellow in
the green coat lapelled with white of the 24th
Chasseurs Ã  Cheval; so thus the daughter of "la
perfide Albion" had it all her own way.
</p>

<p>
Then the old General and Madame de Ribeaupierre
were, as Eugene phrased it in the French
camp style, "like a couple of <i>fourbisseurs</i>," they
sat with their powdered heads so close together;
but they were deep in recollections of the old
court of the Bourbons, of the Scoto-French
alliance, of the days of the monarchy, all of which
Eugene was wont to stigmatize as "the rubbish
of the world before the flood," for he was one of
those young men who wisely, perhaps, don't see
much use in looking back at any time.
</p>

<p>
Lady Rohallion had, of course, innumerable
questions to ask concerning Cosmo; but, kept so
distantly aloof as he had been by that
uncompromising personage, Quentin found great
difficulty in satisfying the anxious mother.  Then
Lord Rohallion asked many a question concerning
the old Borderers; but as Quentin's battalion had
been the second, and was consequently a new one,
he had some difficulty in satisfying all his inquiries.
</p>

<p>
Fresh from foreign service and the seat of war,
whence some rather exaggerated stories of scrapes
and perils had preceded him, Quentin experienced
all the intense boredom of finding himself "an object
of interest."  This annoyance was all the greater,
that he was absorbing and absorbed by Flora, the
heiress, the general's beautiful and wealthy ward,
who had already turned the heads of all the
hard-up fellows in the adjacent garrison towns.
</p>

<p>
All things have an end; even the longest and
most stately of dinners, so in due time the ladies
retired to the drawing-room.  As Madame de
Ribeaupierre passed Quentin, her cheek was
flushed with pleasure and gratified pride by the
attention she had received from the courtly old
lord&mdash;that noble pair d'Ecosse; her eyes were
bright, and she still looked indeed beautiful.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, my child, Quentin, I can see what I can
see," she whispered; "it is she whom you love,
then?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, madame, most dearly," said Quentin,
smiling.
</p>

<p>
"C'est un ange! and I shall always love her,
too!" exclaimed the impulsive Frenchwoman, as
she kissed Flora's blushing cheek.
</p>

<p>
"Quentin, follow us soon," said the latter,
tapping him with her fan; "I want to hear more
about that Spanish lady at the Villa de Maciera."
</p>

<p>
The gentlemen lingered over their wine; much
"shop and pipeclay" were talked, with reserve,
however, as Eugene was present; but the merits
of the new shako, and the probability of the
expected brevet, were as usual fully discussed.
The first to join the ladies in the drawing-room
was Quentin, who felt very much as if in a
dream, from which he might waken to find
himself in the cabin of the <i>Bien AimÃ©</i>, in the Villa
de Orsan, or, worse still, in some comfortless
bivouac in Estremadura; and glad were these
united friends when the guests had taken their
leave, and they were all left to themselves in the
drawing-room.
</p>

<p>
Much conversation and many explanations ensued;
and a very simple remark, by stirring a
certain chord of memory, was the happy means
of bringing about a very unexpected revelation or
dÃ©nouement&mdash;one, indeed, so remarkable as to
deserve a chapter to itself.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXV.
<br /><br />
THE REVELATIONS OF A NIGHT.
</h3>

<p class="intropoem">
  "Gather ye rosebuds while ye may,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Time is still a-flying;<br />
  And this same flower that smiles to-day,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To-morrow will be dying.<br />
  Then be not coy, but use your time,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And while you may, go marry;<br />
  For having lost but once your prime,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You may for ever tarry."&mdash;HERRICK.<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"It has come strangely about, Madame Rohallion,
how my son Eugene, and your&mdash;your friend,
Mr. Kennedy, have met during the contingencies
of service in Spain," said Madame de Ribeaupierre;
"and it is all the more strange that my
name was once Kennedy."
</p>

<p>
We are sorry to say that the good lady
pronounced it Kinnidee.
</p>

<p>
"Yours, madame?"
</p>

<p>
"My first husband was so named."
</p>

<p>
"Madame has then been twice married?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes; and Eugene is the only son of the
general's first wife, for he has been twice married,
too," said Madame Ribeaupierre, with one of her
merry little laughs.
</p>

<p>
"But I have always loved you, madame, as my
mother," said the young officer.
</p>

<p>
"Indeed, child, you never knew any other,"
replied madame, as Eugene kissed her forehead
very affectionately.
</p>

<p>
"Then was your first husband a Scotsman?"
asked Lord Rohallion.
</p>

<p>
"He was, monsieur le general, a captain in the
King's service during the monarchy."
</p>

<p>
"Was he killed in action, madame?"
</p>

<p>
"No, poor man&mdash;he was drowned at sea."
</p>

<p>
"In what year was this?"
</p>

<p>
"Alas! it was in 1798."
</p>

<p>
A keen, bright glance was exchanged by Lord
and Lady Rohallion on hearing this; a light
seemed to break upon their minds simultaneously.
</p>

<p>
"Madame, pardon me," said the lady, very
hurriedly, "but may I enquire what is your
Christian name?"
</p>

<p>
"Josephine."
</p>

<p>
"Josephine!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, madame.  I was named at the font,
Josephine St. Marie DurÃ© de Lusart."
</p>

<p>
"Good heavens, my lord, if it should be so!"
exclaimed Lady Rohallion, hurrying to her
escritoire and bringing forth an old faded and
yellow packet, from which she took a ring&mdash;the
same that had been found on Quentin's father.
It bore, as we have stated elsewhere, the name of
Josephine graven on the gold, and a crest, a
demi-griffin cut on an amethyst.
</p>

<p>
"This ring, madame&mdash;this ring&mdash;where did it
come from?  It was my mother's gift to my first
husband, Captain Kennedy, of the Scottish
regiment de Berwick, in the service of France; and
this letter," continued Madame de Ribeaupierre,
with increasing agitation, "this letter was
mine&mdash;mine, written to him after he had left me
with our child to return to his own country,
whither I was to follow him&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"And this commission, madame?"
</p>

<p>
"Was his&mdash;was his," she exclaimed, becoming
deeply excited, as she pressed to her lips the
signature of Louis XVI.  "How came it here?
And this letter, too, of Monsieur le Comte d'Artois,
written to him after the campaigns on the
Meuse and Rhine?"
</p>

<p>
"They were found in the pocket-book of
Quentin's father, when he was cast drowned on
the beach, with him, then a little child, senseless
and benumbed by cold," said Lady Rohallion,
with one arm placed caressingly round the
Frenchwoman's neck, and with her eyes full of
tears, as the wild and stormy night on which our
story opened came back to memory.
</p>

<p>
Madame Ribeaupierre became quite hysterical.
</p>

<p>
"My son&mdash;you? oh, mon Dieu! mon Dieu! and
this was your secret at the Villa de
Orsan," she exclaimed, in a very touching voice,
as she pressed to her breast the somewhat
bewildered Quentin, who, having been deeply
engaged with Flora, had heard not a word of the
foregoing conversation.
</p>

<p>
After a time, however, she related that her
husband, who had left Scotland in consequence of
some quarrel, she believed, with his own family,
had taken his mother's name of Kennedy, and
entered the regiment de Berwick, in which he
faithfully served the French monarchy, even after
it was completely shattered by the Revolution.
</p>

<p>
That, on a rumour rising that Monsieur, then
residing at Holyrood, was about to reconstitute
the Hundred Scottish Guards, with consent of the
British Government, he departed hurriedly from
France, leaving her at Arques, with her mother,
Madame DurÃ© de Lusart, who was then on her
death-bed.  Accompanied by the AbbÃ© Lebrun,
an old friend, he set out for Scotland, taking
with him their little son.  She added, that the
vessel in which they sailed was a Scottish brig,
under cartel, and bound for the Clyde; but it
was, nevertheless, attacked by a French privateer,
off the coast of Britain somewhere&mdash;where she
knew not&mdash;but far to the north.  The vessel was
driven on a rock, and all perished save the AbbÃ©
Lebrun, who saw both her husband and child sink
into the waves and die together.
</p>

<p>
More fortunate, M. l'AbbÃ© floated out to sea
upon a spar, and was picked up next morning, in
a most exhausted condition, by the same
privateer which had done all the mischief.
</p>

<p>
Notwithstanding all the skill of the great
Doctor Thiebault, who came from Paris, her
mother died, and now she found herself childless
and alone in France&mdash;the terrible France of the
Republic&mdash;and where she was hourly in peril of
the guillotine as an aristocrat.
</p>

<p>
The Bastile had been razed to the ground;
that was good; but the change that had come
over France was not for the better; "the gilded
coach, the red-heeled slipper, and the supper of
the Regency; the powdered marquise, for a smile
of whose dimpled mouth the deadly rapier flashed
in the moonlight&mdash;the perfumed beauty, for one
of whose glances a poet would have ransacked his
brain to render it smoothly in verse;" the high-bred
old courtier, the gilded salon&mdash;had all given
place to regiments of sans-culottes, to assassins,
and the sovereign people&mdash;to the RÃ©publique
dÃ©mocratique et sociale; to planting trees of liberty,
and grape-shotting the mob; to sham Roman
citizens and tribunes; to women debating the
existence of a God, and dancing nude in the fÃªtes
of Venus; to a France of heroes and madmen&mdash;a
Paris of "monkeys and tigers!"
</p>

<p>
Her country had become intolerable to her;
she was long in despair, she said, and but for the
kindness and love of her friend, Marie de Ribeaupierre,
a chauoinesse of the Chapter of Salles, in
Beaujolais, she must have sunk under the loss of
all her friends; but after a time Marie's brother
came; he was then a captain in the regiment of
La Fere, a handsome man, and in the prime of
life, and, happily for himself, stood high in the
favour of Citizen Bonaparte.  In the end, she
added, with a little smile and a very faint blush,
she learned to love him.  They were married,
and then she strove to console herself for the loss
of her own child by making a pet of his, the
little Eugene.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, mon Dieu! mon Dieu!" she exclaimed,
"what subtle instinct was this? what mysterious
voice was that which whispered in my heart
to love you, Quentin?  I have only learned your
name to-night; but how often did I ask of myself,
at the Villa de Orsan, what is this stranger&mdash;this
young Scottish officer&mdash;to me, that I
should feel so deeply interested in him?  Oh,
Ribeaupierre, my dear husband, what a strange
story I shall have to tell you!  That he, for
whom I prayed nightly, and thanked God for
saving the life of <i>your</i> son Eugene, proves to be
mine&mdash;the child of my own bosom&mdash;my long-lost
little Quentin!  Truly the hand of a kind
and blessed Providence has been in all this!"
</p>

<p>
After she became a little more composed, she
desired her maid to bring from her dressing-table
a casket, which she unlocked, saying that she
would show Quentin a miniature of his father&mdash;a
relic on which she had not looked for many
a day; and he gazed on it with eager, earnest,
and mournful tenderness.
</p>

<p>
It was the face of a dark-complexioned and
thoughtful-looking young man, with his hair
simply tied by a blue ribbon; there was a singular
combination of mildness, sadness, and softness in
the features and their expression; but when it
was handed to Lady Rohallion, a sharp little cry,
as if of pain, escaped her.
</p>

<p>
"Reynold&mdash;my lord&mdash;look here&mdash;you know
this face!" she exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
"My brother Ranulph, for a thousand guineas!
Why, madame, this is a miniature of my brother
Ranulph Crawford, who was killed, we were told,
in the defence of the Tuileries."
</p>

<p>
"No&mdash;no&mdash;impossible! impossible!  Captain
Crawford who fell there was our dear friend&mdash;he
commanded the grenadiers of the regiment de
Berwick.  My husband took, I know not why,
his mother's name in France; and that miniature
he hung round my neck on the day we were
married in Arques by the good AbbÃ© Lebrun."
</p>

<p>
"I can swear that it was painted for me,
about three years after Minden, by honest David
Allan of Alloa, whose name should be within it."
</p>

<p>
"True, monsieur, behold!" she added, opening
the locket by a spring; "there is the name of
Monsieur Allan, and this is Quentin's hair, when
it was the colour of gold, woven up with&mdash;with
his poor father's."
</p>

<p>
"This is wonder upon wonder!" exclaimed Flora
Warrender, as she hung on the neck of Madame
de Ribeaupierre, who kept the right hand of
Quentin pressed upon her heart, while Eugene, who
stood by, was stroking his moustache, and thinking
if he had anything to do in the way of kissing,
he would certainly prefer Flora.
</p>

<p>
Lady Rohallion was silent.
</p>

<p>
So the boy, by whose cradle in infancy she
had watched with such motherly solicitude, was
the nephew of her husband, the cousin-german of
Cosmo; the son of that younger brother who had
been the first love of her girlish days&mdash;the
worshipper of her girlish beauty, in the pleasant times
long past in sunny Nithsdale, the courtly gentleman
and gallant soldier of fortune, over whose life she
had cast a shadow.  It was a strange mystery!
</p>

<p>
Some such idea was passing in the mind of
her husband.
</p>

<p>
"Good heavens, Winny! so that poor father,
whose fate is yet a legend among our tenantry&mdash;the
poor man who struggled so bravely to save his
child, when the ship was shattered on the Partan
Craig&mdash;who died in sight of Rohallion, and whom
honest John Girvan buried as became a soldier
in the old kirkyard&mdash;our own ancestral
burying-place&mdash;was my dear brother Ranulph!" exclaimed
Lord Rohallion, with a sudden gush of affection
and emotion; "and 'tis his boy we have so loved
and protected, Winny!  Poor Ranulph&mdash;poor
Ranulph!  I should like to have looked on your
handsome and honest face once again ere it was
laid in the grave; but it could not be, for I was
absent.  Madame, do you know that his drowned
corpse was carried forth by his father's people
from the gate of the house in which he was born,
and every room of which has echoed to his voice
in boyhood, and past the very haunts in which
we played together, under the old sycamores
of the avenue, by the Lollards' Linn and the
Kelpie's Pool, on the Girvan Water.  Thank
God, poor Ranulph, you found a grave at last
among your own people, and where your
forefathers lie; but we have much to make amends
for," added the old Lord, as he placed Flora's hand
in that of Quentin; "may you both live long to
enjoy all the happiness you deserve; and be
assured that my last prayer will be for both of
you!"
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * *
</p>

<p>
What follows?
</p>

<p>
Orange wreaths and snow-white satin dresses,
kid gloves and wedding favours, compliments and
kisses, a marriage settlement and so forth, were
all the subjects for mature consideration ere long
at Minden Lodge; and within a month Quentin
<i>Crawford</i>&mdash;he had to change his name, as well as
Flora&mdash;departed with his bride to spend the
honeymoon among the green summer woods and
purple heather braes of Rohallion; and joyful
indeed was the salute that pealed from the guns on
the battery&mdash;whilome those of La Bonne Citoyenne
under the direction of the old quartermaster,
who concluded by a general salvo that scared the
rooks from the keep, sent the seabirds screaming
in flocks to the Partan Craig, and made the
dominie jump a yard high in his square-toed
shoes; and red and rousing were the bonfires
that blazed on the old castle rock and on the
heights of Ardgour in honour of the day.
</p>

<p>
Cosmo, we have said, was enjoying the seclusion
and safety from duns afforded by the fortress
of Verdun, where we have no wish to disturb
him.
</p>

<p>
Monkton, long since retired upon full pay as
colonel, is still one of the most popular members
of the Caledonian U.S. Club; but poor old
Middleton died a lieutenant-general some years
ago, near his native place, the secluded village
of the Stennis, in Lothian.  The old watch,
which was the providential means of saving his
life in action, he never had repaired; but it
always hung above his mantelpiece with the bullet
in it, for he said that no clock in the land could
ever remind him so well of time and eternity.
</p>

<p>
Donna Isidora accompanied the French troops
to Paris, and made a tremendous sensation as a
Spanish opera-dancer.  In London she became
the rage, and, as <i>La Fille de l'Air</i>, her benefits
were ably puffed and conducted by her secretary,
whose name always figured in the bills as El
Senor Trevino.
</p>

<p>
Old John Girvan "sleeps the sleep that knows
no waking" in the green kirkyard of Rohallion;
but he lived to dandle a young Quentin on his
knee, and to hear the dominie teach a little Flora
to lisp her first letters under the old oak-trees of
Ardgour.
</p>

<p>
Eugene de Ribeaupierre, now one of the generals
of the second Empire, has lived to lead his
division of cavalry at Inkerman and the Tchernaya,
at Solferino and Magenta, as bravely as
ever his father did at Corunna, at Austerlitz, or
Smolensko, in the wars of Napoleon the First.

even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
